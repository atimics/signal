/**
 * Sokol Migration Status Update
 * 
 * Current Status: PIPELINE INVALIDATION ISSUE
 * 
 * Problem: The Sokol graphics pipeline is being created successfully (state=2, which is VALID),
 * but immediately becomes invalid (state=4, which is INVALID) when we try to use it in the frame loop.
 * 
 * Analysis:
 * 1. Pipeline creation is successful - shaders compile, pipeline is created
 * 2. Pipeline becomes invalid immediately when called in render_frame()
 * 3. This suggests a resource lifetime or usage issue
 * 
 * Next Steps:
 * 1. Create a minimal clear-screen-only version first
 * 2. Add basic triangle rendering step by step
 * 3. Focus on getting the basic Sokol loop working before adding complex features
 * 
 * Progress Made:
 * - ✅ Sokol headers integrated
 * - ✅ Build system configured  
 * - ✅ sokol_main entry point implemented
 * - ✅ Basic shader loading system
 * - ❌ Pipeline usage (current blocker)
 * 
 * The SDL-to-Sokol migration is partially complete but blocked on this core rendering issue.
