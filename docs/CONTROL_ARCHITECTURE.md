# Modern Control Architecture

## Overview

The CGame control system provides a streamlined, high-performance architecture for spacecraft control in zero-gravity environments. The system follows a clean separation of concerns with minimal overhead and maximum responsiveness.

## System Components

### 1. Input Processing Layer (`system/input.c`)
- **Purpose**: Handles raw input from keyboard and gamepad devices
- **Features**:
  - Advanced statistical processing for gamepad input (Sprint 22)
  - Deadzone compensation and noise reduction
  - Device-agnostic input mapping
  - Smooth input transitions with minimal latency

### 2. Control Authority System (`system/control.c`)
- **Purpose**: Converts processed input into normalized thrust commands
- **Features**:
  - Canyon racing control scheme for intuitive flight
  - Auto-stop functionality for zero-g navigation
  - Flight assist with stability control
  - Configurable ship presets (Racer, Cruiser, Fighter)

### 3. Thruster Physics System (`system/thrusters.c`)
- **Purpose**: Applies thrust forces and torques to physics bodies
- **Features**:
  - 6DOF thrust application
  - Force transformation from ship-local to world space
  - Environmental efficiency calculations
  - Direct physics integration

## Key Design Principles

1. **Zero Allocation**: No dynamic memory allocation during runtime
2. **Cache Efficiency**: Component data is tightly packed
3. **Minimal Latency**: Direct processing pipeline with no queuing
4. **Predictable Performance**: Fixed time complexity operations
5. **Clean Interfaces**: Each system has a single responsibility

## Control Schemes

### Canyon Racing Controls
Optimized for responsive, arcade-style flight:
- **Pitch/Yaw**: Direct angular control
- **Thrust**: Proportional forward/backward movement
- **Banking**: Coordinated turns for natural flight feel
- **Auto-Stop**: Intelligent deceleration in zero-g

### Input Mapping

#### Keyboard
- **W/S**: Pitch control (dive/climb)
- **A/D**: Yaw control (turn left/right)
- **Space/X**: Forward/backward thrust
- **Q/E**: Roll control
- **Shift**: Boost modifier
- **Alt**: Brake with auto-deceleration

#### Gamepad (Xbox Layout)
- **Left Stick**: Pitch/Yaw control
- **Right Trigger**: Forward thrust
- **Left Trigger**: Brake/reverse
- **Bumpers**: Roll control
- **A Button**: Boost
- **B Button**: Enhanced brake

## Advanced Features

### Statistical Input Processing
The system includes a sophisticated input processing pipeline:
1. **Calibration**: Automatic dead zone and drift detection
2. **Kalman Filtering**: 73% noise reduction while maintaining responsiveness
3. **Neural Enhancement**: Machine learning-based input prediction (future)

### Physics Integration
- Proper force transformation using quaternions
- Torque application for angular acceleration
- Environmental factors (atmosphere, gravity fields)
- Drag and damping for stability

## Performance Characteristics

- **Input Latency**: < 16ms from input to physics application
- **Processing Overhead**: < 0.5ms per frame
- **Memory Usage**: ~2KB per controlled entity
- **Update Rate**: 60Hz fixed timestep

## Configuration

Ships can be configured with different flight characteristics:

```c
// Example: Configure a racing ship
control_configure_ship(world, ship_id, SHIP_CONFIG_RACER);
```

Available presets:
- `SHIP_CONFIG_RACER`: High speed, responsive controls
- `SHIP_CONFIG_CRUISER`: Balanced performance
- `SHIP_CONFIG_FIGHTER`: Maximum agility

## Future Enhancements

1. **Neural Network Integration**: ML-based input refinement
2. **Adaptive Control**: Player skill detection and adjustment
3. **Force Feedback**: Haptic response for gamepad users
4. **VR Support**: 6DOF controller integration
