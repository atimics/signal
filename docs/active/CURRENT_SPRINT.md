## Overview

Sprint 24 pivots from the originally planned Canyon Racing prototype to address critical MicroUI system issues discovered through log analysis. The UI system is currently not rendering any visible content despite executing render commands, which blocks all gameplay UI development.

**Timeline**: July 4-18, 2025
**Status**: ACTIVE ðŸš€

## Key Objectives

1. **Fix Vertex Generation**: Ensure UI elements produce renderable vertices
2. **Debug Command Pipeline**: Trace why commands aren't being generated
3. **Establish Test UI**: Create minimal working UI as validation
4. **Document UI System**: Create comprehensive UI development guide

## Progress Tracking
