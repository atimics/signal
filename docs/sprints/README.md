## Sprint Overview

### What is Sprint 22?
Sprint 22 implements an advanced 3-layer input processing system that enhances gamepad controls through statistical analysis and optional neural network compensation. This builds on Sprint 21's flight mechanics to provide unprecedented control precision.

### Input Processing Layers
1. **Calibration Layer** - Per-device calibration and dead zone compensation
2. **Kalman Filter Layer** - Statistical noise reduction and prediction
3. **Neural Network Layer** - ML-based control refinement (optional)

### Definition of Done
- All three processing layers operational
- Total processing overhead < 0.5ms
- Measurable improvement in control precision
- Positive player feedback on control feel
