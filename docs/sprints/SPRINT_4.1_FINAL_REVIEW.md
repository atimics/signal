# Final Review: Sprint 4.1 - Rendering Refinement

**Report Date:** June 29, 2025
**Status:** Complete

## 1. Sprint Outcome: Success

Sprint 4.1 was a critical success. The primary goal of restoring visual output has been achieved. The engine is no longer "functionally blind," and 3D meshes loaded from the asset pipeline are now visible on screen. This unblocks all future rendering work and provides immediate visual feedback for developers.

The core asset-to-GPU pipeline is now functional:
-   `assets.c` correctly loads mesh and texture data and creates the corresponding `sg_buffer` and `sg_image` resources.
-   The `Renderable` component correctly stores the GPU resource handles.
-   The main render loop now iterates through entities and issues `sg_draw` calls for them.

## 2. Analysis of Implementation & New Technical Debt

To achieve the primary goal quickly, several shortcuts were taken. This was the correct trade-off for this sprint, but it has introduced some minor technical debt that must be addressed before moving on to more advanced rendering features.

-   **Code Organization:** The core mesh rendering logic is currently implemented directly within the main application loop (`main.c`) or the top-level `render_3d.c`. The `render_mesh.c` file remains a placeholder and is not being used.
-   **Basic Shaders:** The current implementation uses a very simple shader that likely only applies a base texture or color, without any lighting calculations.
-   **Missing Transforms:** While meshes are rendering, they are likely not respecting their individual `Transform` components (position, rotation, scale). The Model-View-Projection (MVP) matrix calculation might be incomplete, resulting in all objects rendering at the same location.
-   **Lack of Material System:** The rendering loop does not yet use the `Material` component, meaning meshes are not yet rendered with their correct, semantically-defined material properties.

## 3. Conclusion

This sprint successfully achieved its strategic goal. The identified technical debt is minor, well-understood, and can be addressed in a dedicated cleanup sprint. The project is now in a strong position to proceed with the rest of the rendering roadmap.
