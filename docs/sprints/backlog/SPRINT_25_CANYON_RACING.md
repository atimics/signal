# Sprint 24: Canyon Racing Prototype

**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Dependencies**: Sprint 23 (Technical Excellence) ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Target Start**: July 17, 2025  

## üéØ Sprint Goal

Create an engaging canyon racing prototype that demonstrates CGame's flight mechanics in a competitive, skill-based environment. This vertical slice will validate our core gameplay loop and establish the foundation for content expansion.

## üìã Background

With Sprint 23's technical excellence achieved (98% test coverage, bulletproof foundation), we're ready to rapidly develop gameplay content. The canyon racing prototype leverages our proven systems:
- ‚úÖ 6DOF flight mechanics (Sprint 21)
- ‚úÖ Responsive control system (Sprint 22)  
- ‚úÖ Scripted flight paths (Sprint 23)
- ‚úÖ Stable physics and rendering pipeline
