# CGame Sprint Backlog

This document outlines the planned development sprints for the CGame engine.

## Feature Backlog

### [Sprint 10: PBR Materials & Advanced Lighting](./research/10_pbr_materials.md)
-   **Goal**: Implement Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials with proper lighting calculations, enabling realistic material appearance with metallic, roughness, and normal mapping support.

### [Sprint 11: Advanced Lighting & Shadow Mapping](./research/11_advanced_lighting.md)
-   **Goal**: Implement advanced lighting techniques including shadow mapping, point lights, spot lights, and environmental lighting.

### [Sprint 12: Decal System](./research/12_decal_system.md)
-   **Goal**: Implement a decal system for dynamic surface details like bullet holes, scorch marks, and projected textures.

### [Sprint 13: UI Finalization & Engine Polish](./research/13_ui_integration.md)
-   **Goal**: Finalize the UI system by building out a comprehensive suite of debug and development tools using Nuklear.

### [Sprint 14: Asynchronous AI System](./research/14_async_ai.md)
-   **Goal**: Integrate the `gemma.cpp` inference engine using an asynchronous, multi-threaded job system.

## Technical Debt & Refactoring Backlog

### [Sprint 15: Rendering System Refactor](./research/15_rendering_refactor.md)
-   **Goal**: Refactor the core rendering pipeline to eliminate redundancies and improve modularity.

### [Sprint 16: Asset Pipeline Refactor](./research/16_asset_pipeline_refactor.md)
-   **Goal**: Refactor the asset pipeline to be non-destructive and artist-friendly.
