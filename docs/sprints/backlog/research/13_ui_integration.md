# Sprint 13 Research: UI Finalization & Engine Polish

This document contains the research and best practices for finalizing the UI system and polishing the engine.

## Research Request

Please investigate the following areas to ensure best practices for *enhancing* the existing Nuklear integration:

### Advanced UI Patterns
1.  **Complex Data Binding**: Best practices for binding complex game state (e.g., nested entity components) to Nuklear widgets.
    *   **Best Practice**: Since Nuklear is an immediate mode UI, there is no automatic data binding. The best approach is to write explicit UI functions (e.g., `ui_render_transform_component`) that take a pointer to the component data and render the appropriate widgets.
2.  **Real-time Graphing**: Techniques for creating efficient real-time performance graphs (e.g., for frame time) in Nuklear.
    *   **Best Practice**: Use a circular buffer (or ring buffer) to store the last N frame times. Pass this buffer directly to `nk_plot_function`. This is highly efficient as it avoids reallocating memory each frame.
    *   **Resource**: [Nuklear Demo Code (GitHub)](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear/blob/master/demo/style.c) (see `nk_plot_function` examples)
3.  **Custom Widget Design**: Feasibility and examples of creating custom, reusable UI widgets with Nuklear's API.
    *   **Best Practice**: Create reusable C functions that encapsulate a group of Nuklear widgets. For example, a `widget_vector3_editor(struct nk_context* ctx, const char* label, Vector3* vector)` function can be created to standardize editing of 3D vectors.
