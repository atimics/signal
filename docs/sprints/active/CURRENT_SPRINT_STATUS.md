**Start Date**: July 4, 2025  
**Target End Date**: July 18, 2025  
**Last Updated**: July 4, 2025

## 🎯 Sprint 24: MicroUI System Improvements

### Sprint Overview
Strategic pivot from Canyon Racing to address critical UI rendering issues discovered through system log analysis. MicroUI is processing frames but generating zero vertices, preventing any UI from being visible.

### Critical Issues Found
- **Zero Vertex Generation**: Despite proper frame management, no vertices are being created
- **Empty Command Buffer**: No UI commands being generated from widgets
- **Event Timing Issues**: Events arriving outside of active frame windows
- **No Visible UI**: Complete UI system failure preventing all interface development

### Sprint Goals
1. **Diagnose and Fix**: Root cause analysis of vertex generation failure
2. **Establish Working UI**: Get at least one visible UI element on screen
3. **Build Foundation**: Create core widget set for future development
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensure UI system reliability

## 🔧 Technical Status

### What's Working
- ✅ MicroUI initialization and shutdown
- ✅ Frame begin/end lifecycle  
- ✅ Clip rectangle management
- ✅ Basic render loop integration

### What's Broken
- ❌ Widget command generation
- ❌ Vertex buffer population
- ❌ Event delivery timing
- ❌ Any visible UI output

### Root Cause Hypothesis
The issue appears to be in the widget layer - widgets aren't generating commands, which means no vertices are created for rendering. This could be due to:
1. Missing widget creation calls
2. Incorrect context state
3. Layout calculation failures
4. Command buffer not being flushed

## 📈 Metrics

### Current State
- **UI Tests**: 0 (to be created)
- **Visible UI Elements**: 0
- **Frame Impact**: Minimal (no vertices to render)
- **Memory Usage**: Unknown

### Target State  
- **UI Tests**: 10+ comprehensive tests
- **Visible UI Elements**: Full widget set
- **Frame Impact**: <1ms for typical UI
- **Memory Usage**: <10MB for UI system

---

## 🚧 Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
1. **Zero Vertex Generation**: Preventing any UI visibility
2. **Unknown Root Cause**: Requires investigation

### Mitigation Strategy
- Phase 1: Add comprehensive logging
- Phase 2: Create minimal reproducible case
- Phase 3: Step-by-step debugging
- Fallback: Custom immediate mode UI if MicroUI unfixable

---

## 📝 Next Actions

### Immediate (Day 1)
1. ✅ Create Sprint 24 documentation
2. ✅ Archive Sprint 23
3. [ ] Add comprehensive UI logging
4. [ ] Create minimal button test
5. [ ] Run with debugging to trace execution

### Tomorrow (Day 2)
1. [ ] Deep dive into widget creation
2. [ ] Verify command buffer state
3. [ ] Check vertex generation path
4. [ ] Document all findings
