# Sprint 14: Implementation Guide - Pipeline & Polish

**ID**: `sprint_14.0`
**Status**: **ACTIVE & CRITICAL**
**Author**: Gemini, Chief Science Officer

## 1. Progress Update & Revised Goals

Excellent progress has been made by the development team. The core headers (`assets.h`, `core.h`) have been fully documented, and a new mesh validation tool has been created.

This sprint's focus will now shift to the final integration of these components and the completion of the project-wide code style enforcement.

**Revised Sprint Goal**: To finalize the mesh generation pipeline, integrate the new validation tool, and enforce a universal code style, resulting in a fully polished, robust, and maintainable codebase.

## 2. Core Tasks & Implementation Plan

### Task 1: Finalize and Verify the Asset Pipeline (In Progress)

*   **Objective**: To ensure the entire asset pipeline, from procedural generation to binary compilation, is robust and correct.
*   **Sub-Task 1.1 (COMPLETED)**: The `mesh_generator` has been refactored to produce textured `.obj` source files.
*   **Sub-Task 1.2 (COMPLETED)**: The `build_pipeline.py` now correctly compiles source assets into the binary `.cobj` format and generates the necessary metadata and index files.
*   **Sub-Task 1.3 (TO DO)**: **Integrate `validate_mesh.py`**. The main `build_pipeline.py` should be updated to call the new `validate_mesh.py` script as a final step. The build should fail if the validation step reports any errors. This provides a critical quality gate for our assets.

### Task 2: Enforce Universal Code Style

*   **Objective**: To apply a universal code format across the entire C codebase, eliminating style inconsistencies and improving readability.
*   **Sub-Task 2.1 (TO DO)**: **Create and Apply `.clang-format`**.
    *   Create a `.clang-format` file in the project root (e.g., based on the "Google" style).
    *   Run `clang-format -i src/**/*.c src/**/*.h tests/**/*.c tests/**/*.h` to format the entire C codebase. This is a one-time action that will standardize the project's style.
*   **Sub-Task 2.2 (COMPLETED)**: The public headers `assets.h` and `core.h` have been fully documented with Doxygen-style comments.
*   **Sub-Task 2.3 (TO DO)**: **Final Documentation Pass**. Perform a final review of all remaining public headers in `src/` to ensure they meet the same high standard of documentation.

### Task 3: Review Untracked Files

*   **Objective**: To ensure all relevant work is captured in the repository.
*   **Guidance**: Review the untracked file `docs/sprints/active/LOADING_SCREEN_ACHIEVEMENT.md`. If it contains valuable information, it should be integrated into a relevant sprint review or guide. If it is a temporary note, it should be removed.

## 3. Definition of Done (Revised)

1.  The `build_pipeline.py` now includes a mandatory, final validation step using `validate_mesh.py`.
2.  A `.clang-format` file exists, and all C code has been formatted.
3.  All public headers in `src/` are fully and consistently documented.
4.  The `make generate-assets` and `make assets` commands complete successfully, producing valid, textured, binary assets.
5.  The main application (`make run`) correctly renders all procedural and static assets.
6.  The `git status` is clean, with no untracked or unstaged documentation files.
