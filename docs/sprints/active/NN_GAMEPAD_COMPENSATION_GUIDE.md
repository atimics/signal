## 1. Introduction: The Pursuit of Perfect Input

Modern gamepads, despite their prevalence, suffer from inherent physical limitations. Potentiometer-based analog sticks, which form the majority of the market, are prone to manufacturing tolerances of up to ±8%, leading to inconsistent behavior out of the box. Over time, mechanical wear introduces issues like center drift and non-linear "oval" gate responses.

Traditional static dead-zones are a crude solution. They can temporarily mask drift, but fail to adapt as the hardware ages and cannot correct for non-linearities. This results in a suboptimal, and often frustrating, user experience.

This paper proposes a novel, learning-based approach to gamepad input processing. By leveraging a small neural network, we can provide *personalized linearity* for any controller, adapting in real-time to its unique quirks and wear characteristics. The goal is to deliver a "smooth-AF out-of-the-box" experience that remains consistent throughout the life of the hardware, with minimal performance overhead.

## 2. System Architecture: A Hybrid Approach

Our proposed system is a hybrid, multi-layered stack that combines statistical modeling, machine learning, and proven control theory to achieve robust and high-fidelity input processing.

The core components are:

1.  **Statistical Baseline**: An online statistical model (as detailed in `SPRINT_22_ADVANCED_INPUT_PROCESSING_RESEARCH.md`) provides a robust baseline for the controller's state, estimating center drift and noise characteristics. This layer feeds key features into the neural network.
2.  **Tiny Meta-Trained MLP**: A small, efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) acts as the core of the system. It learns the unique non-linear quirks of the specific gamepad in use. It is pre-trained on a wide variety of simulated hardware faults and then fine-tuned on the user's actual device.
3.  **Continual Learning**: The network continually adapts in the background to slow-onset drift, ensuring the controller's response remains consistent over months of use.
4.  **MRAC Safety Wrapper**: A Model-Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) layer acts as a safety shell around the neural network output, guaranteeing system stability even in the face of unexpected network behavior.

This entire stack is designed to run within the main game loop (`frame()`) with a negligible performance footprint (< 0.1 ms/frame).

## 3. Feature Engineering: What the Network Sees

The performance of any neural network is highly dependent on the quality of its input features. We have selected a concise yet powerful feature vector that provides the network with a rich understanding of the controller's state at frame `k`.

**Feature Vector `ϕk` (14 dimensions):**

| Feature(s)          | Type      | Description                                                              |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `raw_lx`, `raw_ly`  | `float32` | Raw, un-normalized X/Y values from the left analog stick.                |
| `|raw|`             | `float32` | Magnitude of the raw stick vector.                                       |
| `Δlx`, `Δly`        | `float32` | 1-frame derivative (velocity) of the stick position.                     |
| `rdz_est`, `g_est`  | `float32` | Dynamic inner dead-zone radius and gain estimates from the stats block.  |
| `age_norm`          | `float32` | Normalized time since the pad was connected (0-1 range).                 |
| `prev_out[6]`       | `int16`   | The previous frame's final 6-DoF command output.                         |

**Rationale:**
*   **Raw Inputs**: Feeding the network raw sensor values is critical. It allows the model to learn the specific hardware characteristics (e.g., gate shape, drift) without being biased by premature normalization.
*   **Derivatives**: The 1-frame derivative provides velocity information, crucial for modeling inertia and predicting future movement.
*   **Statistical Priors**: The dead-zone and gain estimates from the statistical layer give the network a strong starting point for its own predictions.
*   **Age**: The normalized age helps the model account for long-term wear patterns.
*   **Previous Output**: Including the last command output helps the network model physical inertia and create smoother control transitions.

## 4. Network Architecture: Small, Fast, and Effective

For real-time use on the render thread, the network must be extremely efficient. Our proposed architecture achieves this with a minimal footprint in terms of both computation and memory.

**MLP Architecture:**

| Layer | Size | Activation | Weights        | Comment                                        |
| ----- | ---- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| FC1   | 32   | `tanh`     | 32 × 14 = 448  | First fully-connected layer.                   |
| FC2   | 32   | `tanh`     | 32 × 32 = 1024 | Second fully-connected layer.                  |
| FC3   | 6    | `tanh`     | 6 × 32 = 192   | Output layer for 6-DoF control.                |

**Key Characteristics:**
*   **Total Multiplies**: ~2,000 multiply-accumulate operations per forward pass.
*   **Performance**: < 0.02 ms on a single Ryzen Zen 3 core.
*   **Memory Footprint**: ~9 KB after `int8` quantization.

This small size is intentional. Research in meta-learning indicates that for fast adaptation problems, the quality of the features is more important than the width of the network.

## 5. The Learning Process: A Three-Stage Approach

The network is trained in three distinct stages to be both general and highly specialized.

### 5.1 Stage 1: Offline Meta-Pretraining

This is a one-time, offline process performed by the developers.

1.  **Data Generation**: We create a "zoo" of thousands of virtual gamepads, each with simulated hardware flaws:
    *   **Jitter**: 0–2% Gaussian noise on inputs.
    *   **Drift**: Random bias ramps (0–400 counts over 60 minutes).
    *   **Gate Squish**: Asymmetric scaling of X or Y axes (0.85–1.1).
2.  **Closed-Loop Simulation**: Each virtual controller is used to fly scripted maneuvers in our Sokol-based 6-DoF test environment.
3.  **Training**: The network is trained to minimize the tracking error between the simulated flight path and a perfect reference trajectory.
    *   **Optimizer**: Adam.
    *   **Schedule**: 20,000 steps with a cosine learning rate decay from 1e-3 to 1e-4.
4.  **Output**: This process produces a single, generalized model checkpoint: `padnet_meta.onnx` (~10 KB).

### 5.2 Stage 2: First-Use Few-Shot Calibration

This is a rapid, one-time calibration that occurs the first time a new gamepad is connected.

1.  **Micro-Game**: The user plays a simple 10-second game (e.g., "keep the reticle inside the moving box"). This can be seamlessly integrated into the "press any button to start" sequence.
2.  **Fine-Tuning**: During this game, we run ~100 episodes and update **only the first layer's weights** (`FC1`) using SGD. The deeper, more general layers remain frozen. This adapts the model to the specific device's quirks using only ~360 parameters.

### 5.3 Stage 3: Continual Drift Adaptation

This is a continuous, low-intensity process that runs in the background at 60 Hz.

1.  **Replay Buffer**: We maintain an 8-second FIFO replay buffer of recent input/output pairs.
2.  **Background SGD**: Once per second, we perform a single SGD step on the network weights using a sample from the buffer.
3.  **Regularization**: A strong L2 regularizer pulls the weights towards the initial meta-trained prior (`padnet_meta.onnx`).

This technique, borrowed from continual learning research, allows the model to slowly adapt to long-term hardware drift without suffering from "catastrophic forgetting."

## 6. Safety Net: Control Theory Wrappers

Wrapping a neural network in a real-time control loop requires a robust safety net. We use two proven techniques from control theory to guarantee stability.

### 6.1 Lyapunov-Backed MRAC Shell

The entire NN output is wrapped in a Model-Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) layer. This ensures that the closed-loop system remains provably stable, even if the network produces erroneous or unstable outputs. We can leverage recent research in multilateral-learning MRAC to blend the NN output with a stable linear controller.

### 6.2 Residual Gating

The final control command `u` is a blend of the neural network output `u_nn` and the output from the simpler statistical model `u_stats`.

`u = λ · u_nn + (1-λ) · u_stats`

The blending factor `λ` ramps from 0 to 1 over 5 seconds, but only when the system is confident in the NN's output (i.e., low innovation from the Kalman filter block). If the innovation Z-score exceeds a threshold (e.g., 4), `λ` is reset to 0, and the system falls back to the safe, statistically-derived controller.

## 7. C Implementation Guide

The core inference logic can be implemented in a single, self-contained C function. The following is a reference implementation for an `int8` quantized model.

```c
// File: src/system_input_nn.c (new file)
#define PADNET_INPUT 14
#define PADNET_HIDDEN 32
#define PADNET_OUTPUT 6
#include "padnet_int8_weights.h"   // Generated from ONNX model

/**
 * @brief Performs a forward pass of the padnet neural network.
 * @param w1 Pointer to the int8 weights of the first layer.
 * @param w2 Pointer to the int8 weights of the second layer.
 * @param w3 Pointer to the int8 weights of the third layer.
 * @param in Pointer to the float input feature vector (size PADNET_INPUT).
 * @param out Pointer to the float output vector (size PADNET_OUTPUT).
 */
static inline void padnet_fwd(const int8_t* w1, const int8_t* w2,
                              const int8_t* w3,
                              const float* in, float* out)
{
    float h1[PADNET_HIDDEN], h2[PADNET_HIDDEN];

    // Layer 1: Input -> Hidden1
    for (int i = 0; i < PADNET_HIDDEN; ++i) {
        int32_t s = 0; // Use 32-bit accumulator
        for (int j = 0; j < PADNET_INPUT; ++j) {
            // This assumes input 'in' is scaled to [-1, 1] and then quantized to int8
            // For simplicity, we're showing float input here.
            // A real implementation would quantize 'in' first.
            s += w1[i * PADNET_INPUT + j] * (in[j] * 127.0f);
        }
        // Dequantize and apply activation
        h1[i] = tanhf(s / (127.0f * 127.0f));
    }

    // Layer 2: Hidden1 -> Hidden2
    for (int i = 0; i < PADNET_HIDDEN; ++i) {
        int32_t s = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < PADNET_HIDDEN; ++j) {
            s += w2[i * PADNET_HIDDEN + j] * (h1[j] * 127.0f);
        }
        h2[i] = tanhf(s / (127.0f * 127.0f));
    }

    // Layer 3: Hidden2 -> Output
    for (int i = 0; i < PADNET_OUTPUT; ++i) {
        int32_t s = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < PADNET_HIDDEN; ++j) {
            s += w3[i * PADNET_HIDDEN + j] * (h2[j] * 127.0f);
        }
        out[i] = tanhf(s / (127.0f * 127.0f));
    }
}
```
*Note: The C code has been slightly modified from the source to show a more complete int8 quantization/dequantization flow and to use a 32-bit accumulator to prevent overflow.*

This function should be called within the main game loop, after the statistical and Kalman filter updates have been performed to generate the input feature vector.

## 8. Key Tuning Parameters

The system's behavior can be fine-tuned with a few key parameters:

| Knob            | Sweet-spot  | Effect                                                              |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `α` (stats EMA) | 0.001–0.003 | Learning rate for the statistical block. Defines horizon for bias capture. |
| KF `Q/R` ratio  | 1e-3        | Kalman Filter noise ratio. Too low → lag; too high → jitter.        |
| Meta-LR         | 1e-3        | Learning rate for offline meta-pretraining.                         |
| Drift SGD LR    | 1e-4        | Learning rate for continual drift adaptation. Higher risks instability. |

## 9. Expected User Experience

A successful implementation of this system will result in a controller that feels:

*   **Instantly Intuitive**: Even cheap, $15 gamepads will feel responsive and precise.
*   **Perfectly Symmetrical**: The force required to pull left vs. right will feel identical (within 0.2%).
*   **Zero-Configuration**: Players will never need to see or touch a dead-zone slider. The system calibrates itself within seconds of gameplay.
*   **Predictable for Life**: The controller's response will remain consistent for months or years, as the NN continuously learns and compensates for hardware wear.

## 10. Conclusion

By combining a small, efficient neural network with robust statistical modeling and principles from control theory, we can solve the long-standing problem of inconsistent and degrading gamepad performance. This approach provides a tangible improvement to the user experience, is computationally inexpensive, and ensures long-term stability and adaptability. It represents a significant step forward in creating truly "smooth-AF" input systems.
