# Sprint Documentation Consolidation Summary

## Date: July 2, 2025

## What Was Done

### 1. Document Organization Review
- Confirmed Sprint 21 documents are already properly archived in `completed/sprint_21/`
- Sprint 22 is the current active sprint with Phase 1 complete
- No documents needed to be moved - organization was already correct

### 2. Created Consolidated Sprint 22 Guide
- **File**: `SPRINT_22_CONSOLIDATED_GUIDE.md`
- Combined information from all Sprint 22 documents
- Added current code state analysis
- Included clear implementation steps for Phase 2
- Added performance targets and testing strategy

### 3. Updated Project Documentation
- **README.md**: Updated to show Sprint 22 as active, Sprint 21 as complete
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated to reflect current sprint status and recent achievements
- Fixed broken links to Sprint 21 documents (now point to completed folder)

## Key Findings

### Sprint Status
- **Sprint 21**: 98% complete (only visual thruster rendering remains)
- **Sprint 22**: Phase 1 complete (40% overall), Phase 2 in progress
- **Sprint 23**: Planned for technical debt remediation (critical)

### Technical State
- 6DOF flight mechanics fully functional
- Statistical input filtering operational (73% noise reduction)
- Neural network architecture designed, implementation pending
- 60% test failure rate needs urgent attention (Sprint 23)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Focus on completing Sprint 22 Phase 2 (neural network)
2. Start collecting diverse gamepad training data
3. Plan for Sprint 23 technical debt work

### Documentation Maintenance
1. Keep CLAUDE.md updated with sprint progress
2. Archive Sprint 22 docs when complete
3. Create Sprint 23 active docs when starting

### Process Improvements
1. Update main docs (README, CLAUDE.md) when sprints complete
2. Consolidate sprint docs at major milestones
3. Keep "current state" sections in guides up to date

## Conclusion

The consolidation revealed that the project documentation was already well-organized, with Sprint 21 properly archived and Sprint 22 actively documented. The main issue was that the high-level documentation (README.md and CLAUDE.md) hadn't been updated to reflect the current state. This has now been corrected, and a comprehensive consolidated guide for Sprint 22 has been created to help with the ongoing neural network implementation.
