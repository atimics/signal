# Sprint 09 Review: Texture System Implementation

**Sprint Dates**: [Assumed Start Date] - [Assumed End Date]
**Lead Developer**: [Assumed Developer]

## 1. Sprint Goal Assessment

The primary goal of this sprint was to implement a complete texture loading and GPU binding system, enabling meshes to be rendered with proper textures instead of solid colors.

**Outcome: âœ… Achieved**

The sprint was a success. The core tasks of loading textures to the GPU, updating the shaders to sample them, and modifying the render pipeline to bind them were all completed. The engine is no longer limited to solid colors and can now render fully textured meshes, which is a major step forward for visual fidelity.

## 2. Retrospective

### What Went Well

*   **GPU Resource Management**: The integration with Sokol's `sg_image` and `sg_make_image` was successful, and textures are now correctly managed on the GPU.
*   **Shader Updates**: The fragment shader was successfully modified to sample from a diffuse texture and modulate it with the material color, which worked as expected.
*   **Pipeline Integration**: The rendering pipeline now correctly associates materials with textures and binds them for drawing. The fallback to a default white texture for untextured materials is a nice touch of robustness.

### What Could Be Improved

*   **Lack of Multi-Texture Support**: While the foundation was laid, the current implementation only supports a single diffuse texture. The PBR workflow will require a more advanced system for binding multiple textures (albedo, normal, metallic, etc.).
*   **No Mipmapping**: The current implementation does not generate mipmaps for textures. This will lead to aliasing artifacts on distant objects and is a critical feature to add for production quality.
*   **Asset Pipeline Bottleneck**: The process of loading textures is still part of the main application's startup. For larger projects, this should be moved to the offline asset pipeline to reduce loading times.

## 3. Action Items for Future Sprints

*   **Implement PBR Materials**: The next logical step is to build on this foundation and implement a full PBR material system, which will require multi-texture support. (This is the goal of Sprint 10).
*   **Add Mipmap Generation**: The asset pipeline should be updated to automatically generate mipmaps for all textures.
*   **Refactor Asset Loading**: In the long term, the texture loading process should be moved to the offline asset pipeline to improve application startup times.
