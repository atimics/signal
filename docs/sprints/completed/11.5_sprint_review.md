# Sprint 11.5 Review: Graphics API Stabilization

**Sprint Dates**: [Assumed Start Date] - [Assumed End Date]
**Lead**: Gemini (Lead Scientist and Researcher)

## 1. Sprint Goal Assessment

The goal of this sprint was to achieve full compliance with the `R06` architectural guide by refactoring all graphics-related data structures to use the **Opaque Pointer (PIMPL) Idiom**.

**Outcome: âœ… Achieved**

The sprint was a complete and unqualified success. All criteria in the "Definition of Done" were met. No public engine headers expose Sokol GFX types, the full test suite passes, and the main application compiles and runs correctly. The engine's graphics API is now fully decoupled, stable, and maintainable.

## 2. Retrospective

### What Went Well

*   **Targeted Refactoring**: The decision to pause feature development for this focused architectural sprint was validated. We addressed a significant source of technical debt and instability in a short, controlled manner.
*   **Test-Driven Validation**: The existing test suite was invaluable. The test failures immediately highlighted the exact locations that needed to be updated to comply with the new PIMPL interface, guiding the refactoring process.
*   **PIMPL Implementation**: The final implementation is clean and correctly hides all underlying Sokol types from the public API, which was the primary goal.

### What Could Be Improved

*   **Test Suite Brittleness**: The refactoring revealed some brittleness in the test suite itself (e.g., duplicate `setUp`/`tearDown` functions, incorrect macro usage). While this was fixed, it highlights that the test code deserves the same level of care and attention as the engine code.

## 3. Action Items for Future Sprints

*   **Proceed with PBR (Sprint 11)**: The graphics API is now stable and ready. We are fully unblocked to begin work on the PBR rendering pipeline.
*   **Code Cleanup (Sprint 11.6)**: The analysis performed during this sprint identified several areas for code cleanup and consolidation. This sprint remains in the backlog as a valuable "cool-down" activity after the PBR sprint.

## 4. Sprint Artifacts

*   **Consolidated Guide**: `docs/sprints/active/sprint_11.5_pimpl_refactoring.md`
*   **Architectural Compliance**: The codebase now adheres to the principles outlined in `docs/research/R06_C_Header_Architecture.md`.
