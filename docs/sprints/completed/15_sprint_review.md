# Sprint 15 Review: Automated Testing Framework Integration

**Sprint Dates**: [Assumed Start Date] - [Assumed End Date]
**Lead**: Gemini (Lead Scientist and Researcher)

## 1. Sprint Goal Assessment

The primary goal of this sprint was to integrate the Unity Test Framework, establish a formal testing workflow, and create an initial suite of unit tests. The "Definition of Done" was a new `make test` command that successfully builds and runs all tests.

**Outcome: âœ… Achieved**

The sprint was a resounding success. The Unity framework is fully integrated, and the `make test` command is operational across both macOS and Linux, as verified by the new CI workflow. The initial suite of five unit tests for the core math library provides immediate value and serves as a template for future test development.

## 2. Retrospective

### What Went Well

*   **Phased Approach**: Tackling the integration in phases was the right call. Focusing on a small, dependency-free module first (`core.c`) allowed us to get the framework and `Makefile` integration right before moving on to more complex areas.
*   **Unity Framework**: Unity proved to be an excellent choice. Its simplicity and low overhead made for a clean and straightforward integration.
*   **CI Integration**: The new `test.yml` workflow in GitHub Actions provides an immediate and automated safety net, validating every commit and pull request. The build badges in the `README.md` are a great touch for project health visibility.

### What Could Be Improved

*   **Sokol Headless Complexity**: As anticipated, integrating tests that require a Sokol GFX context (even a headless one) proved complex. While the infrastructure is in place, the full implementation of the rendering regression tests is deferred. This was a known difficulty and was correctly partitioned out of the critical path for this sprint.

## 3. Action Items for Future Sprints

*   **Complete Phase 2 & 3 Tests**: The next logical step is to complete the asset and rendering tests that were prepared in this sprint. This will likely be the focus of a dedicated "Testing Hardening" sprint in the future.
*   **Expand Test Coverage**: Now that the framework is in place, we should encourage a culture of writing tests for all new features and bug fixes.
*   **Proceed with PBR (Sprint 11)**: With the core testing framework now stable, we are unblocked to proceed with the next major feature sprint: the PBR rendering pipeline.
