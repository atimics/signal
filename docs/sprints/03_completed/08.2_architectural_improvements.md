# Sprint 08.2: Architectural Improvements Implementation

**Status**: Active  
**Started**: June 30, 2025  
**Focus**: Implementing architectural review recommendations

## Completed âœ…

### Critical Rendering Issues Fixed
- [x] **Depth Buffer**: Enabled proper depth testing (`SG_COMPAREFUNC_LESS_EQUAL`) and writing
- [x] **Face Culling**: Enabled back-face culling with correct Metal winding order (`SG_FACEWINDING_CW`)
- [x] **ECS Camera Integration**: Removed temporary camera overrides, now using proper ECS camera matrices
- [x] **Pipeline Validation**: All GPU resources and pipeline states are valid
- [x] **Entity Visibility**: 4/4 entities are being rendered consistently

### Results
- Entities are now processed and rendered correctly
- MVP matrices calculated properly from ECS components
- Camera system fully integrated and functional
- Performance is stable with all systems running

## Next Phase: Advanced Material System ðŸŽ¨

### 1. Material Component Implementation
```c
struct Material {
    // Base properties
    Vector3 base_color;
    float metallic;
    float roughness;
    float emissive_strength;
    
    // Texture references
    AssetID diffuse_texture;
    AssetID normal_texture;
    AssetID roughness_texture;
    AssetID emissive_texture;
    
    // Shader configuration
    uint32_t shader_flags;  // Bitfield for feature toggles
    float alpha_cutoff;     // For alpha testing
};
```

### 2. Lighting System Enhancement
- [ ] Implement PBR (Physically Based Rendering) workflow
- [ ] Add support for multiple light types (point, spot, area)
- [ ] Integrate with material system for realistic lighting
- [ ] Add shadow mapping support

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement spatial partitioning for collision system (octree/grid)
- [ ] Add dynamic component pools with free lists
- [ ] Implement mesh LOD system
- [ ] Add frustum culling for rendering

### 4. Asset Pipeline Enhancements
- [ ] Live asset reloading during development
- [ ] Extended semantic material system
- [ ] Automatic normal map generation
- [ ] Texture atlas optimization

## Technical Debt Resolution ðŸ”§

### Memory Management
- [ ] Dynamic component pools instead of fixed MAX_ENTITIES
- [ ] Free list implementation for component deallocation
- [ ] Memory pool allocators for temporary objects

### System Architecture
- [ ] Event system for inter-system communication
- [ ] Job system for parallel processing
- [ ] Resource streaming for large worlds

## Performance Targets ðŸŽ¯

- Maintain 60+ FPS with 100+ entities
- Sub-1ms physics system updates
- Efficient collision detection for dense scenes
- Smooth camera transitions and controls

## Testing & Validation ðŸ§ª

### Rendering Tests
- [ ] Complex mesh rendering with multiple materials
- [ ] Dynamic lighting scenarios
- [ ] Large scene stress testing
- [ ] Multiple camera angle validation

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Entity count scaling tests
- [ ] Memory usage profiling
- [ ] System timing analysis
- [ ] Asset loading benchmarks

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Material system and PBR lighting
2. **Medium Priority**: Spatial partitioning and performance optimizations  
3. **Low Priority**: Advanced asset pipeline features

This represents the next phase of CGame development, building on the solid ECS foundation and rendering pipeline that are now working correctly.
