# Sprint 19: Test-Driven Development Plan

**Sprint**: 19 - Performance Optimization & Polish  
**Approach**: Test-Driven Development (TDD)  
**Date**: July 1, 2025

## ðŸŽ¯ Test-Driven Development Strategy

### TDD Cycle
1. **RED**: Write failing tests for new functionality
2. **GREEN**: Implement minimal code to make tests pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code while keeping tests passing

### Test Categories

#### 1. **Unit Tests** (Isolated Components)
- Individual functions and data structures
- No external dependencies
- Fast execution (<100ms total)

#### 2. **Integration Tests** (System Interactions)
- ECS system interactions
- Asset loading pipeline
- Memory management integration

#### 3. **Performance Tests** (Benchmark Validation)
- Memory usage under load
- Frame rate stability
- Asset loading times

#### 4. **Regression Tests** (Quality Assurance)
- Prevent breaking changes
- Validate bug fixes
- Cross-platform compatibility

```

### Test Coverage Goals
- **Unit Tests**: >90% code coverage
- **Integration Tests**: All major system interactions
- **Performance Tests**: All performance-critical paths
- **Regression Tests**: All previously reported bugs

### Automated Testing
- **CI Integration**: All tests run on every commit
- **Performance Baselines**: Track performance regressions
- **Cross-Platform**: Tests run on macOS, Linux, WebAssembly
- **Quality Gates**: All tests must pass before merge

## ðŸ“Š Test Metrics & Reporting

### Key Metrics
1. **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests
2. **Test Execution Time**: Time to run full test suite
3. **Test Reliability**: Percentage of tests that pass consistently
4. **Performance Baselines**: Benchmark comparisons over time

### Reporting
- **Test Reports**: Generated after each test run
- **Coverage Reports**: HTML reports showing coverage gaps
- **Performance Reports**: Graphs showing performance trends
- **CI Integration**: Test results in pull request status checks

## ðŸ”§ Testing Tools & Infrastructure

### Testing Framework
- **Unity**: C unit testing framework (already integrated)
- **Custom Mocks**: Mock objects for external dependencies
