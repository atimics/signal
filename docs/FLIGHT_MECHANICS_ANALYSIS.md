# Flight Mechanics Analysis - Current State & Issues

**Date**: July 2, 2025  
**Status**: Investigation Complete  
**Priority**: High - Core gameplay experience

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Flight Mechanics State**

### âœ… **What Works Well**
1. **Comprehensive Input System**: Unified keyboard + gamepad abstraction with proper analog support
2. **Advanced Camera System**: Multiple camera modes (cockpit, chase near/far, overhead) with dynamic behavior
3. **Flight Test Scene**: Well-designed testing environment with obstacles and open plain
4. **Physics Integration**: Basic velocity/acceleration physics working correctly
5. **Visual Polish**: Camera shake, dynamic FOV, velocity-based effects
6. **Performance**: Smooth 60+ FPS with complex camera calculations

### ðŸš¨ **Critical Issues Identified**

#### 1. **Physics System Problems**
**File**: `src/system/physics.c:29-41`
- **Ground Effect Disabled**: Racing mechanics commented out due to "causing player ship to fly away"
- **Over-Simplified Physics**: Basic acceleration/velocity only, no proper force dynamics
- **No 6DOF Control**: Missing pitch, yaw, roll for true spaceflight feel
- **Linear Drag Only**: No atmospheric or realistic drag models

```c
// DISABLED: Ground-effect racing mechanics for ships - causing player ship to fly away
// DISABLED: Ships get speed boost when flying close to ground (ground effect)
// SIMPLIFIED: Apply basic acceleration to velocity
// SIMPLIFIED: Apply basic drag
```

#### 2. **Flight Controls Limitations**
**Files**: `src/scripts/flight_test_scene.c:325-393`, `src/system/input.c`
- **No Rotation Control**: Ships can't pitch, yaw, or roll naturally
- **Unrealistic Movement**: Direct force application without proper physics
- **Missing Inertia**: Instant acceleration/deceleration feels arcade-like
- **No Flight Model**: Lacks atmospheric or space flight characteristics

#### 3. **Camera-Ship Disconnect**
**File**: `src/scripts/flight_test_scene.c:144-323`
- **Camera-Heavy Logic**: Most "flight feel" comes from camera effects, not ship physics
- **Artificial Enhancement**: Camera shake and FOV changes mask poor physics
- **Follow Behavior Issues**: Camera system more complex than flight physics

#### 4. **Limited Scene Integration**
- **Test Scene Only**: Flight mechanics only properly implemented in `flight_test`
- **Derelict Scene Problems**: Different physics behavior in navigation scenes
- **No Consistency**: Each scene implements its own flight variants

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Analysis**

### **Physics System Architecture Issues**

```c
// Current (src/system/physics.c:44-47)
physics->velocity = vector3_add(physics->velocity, vector3_multiply(physics->acceleration, delta_time));
physics->velocity = vector3_multiply(physics->velocity, physics->drag);
transform->position = vector3_add(transform->position, vector3_multiply(physics->velocity, delta_time));
```

**Problems**:
- No force accumulation
- No mass consideration
- No angular dynamics
- Linear drag model insufficient for spaceflight

### **Input System Analysis**

```c
// Current (src/system/input.c:54-62)
if (keyboard_state[INPUT_ACTION_THRUST_FORWARD]) current_input.thrust += 1.0f;
if (keyboard_state[INPUT_ACTION_STRAFE_RIGHT]) current_input.strafe += 1.0f;
if (keyboard_state[INPUT_ACTION_MANEUVER_UP]) current_input.vertical += 1.0f;
```

**Missing**:
- Pitch/yaw/roll controls
- Analog thrust curves
- Flight mode switching (atmospheric vs space)
- Thruster vectoring

### **Camera System Over-Engineering**

The camera system in `flight_test_scene.c` is doing most of the "flight feel" work:
- Velocity-based lag (lines 232-251)
- Speed-based distance adjustment (lines 254-269)
- Camera shake for movement sensation (lines 277-306)
- Dynamic FOV for speed sensation (lines 296-305)

**Problem**: The ship physics are so basic that camera tricks provide the flight experience.

## ðŸš€ **Required Improvements for Sprint 21**

## ðŸŽ® **User Experience Issues**

### **Current Flight Feel Problems**

1. **Lacks Spaceflight Authenticity**
   - Feels like sliding blocks, not spaceships
   - No sense of mass or momentum
   - Missing rotational dynamics

2. **Camera Dependency**
   - Flight excitement comes from camera, not physics
   - Inconsistent when camera changes
   - Masks underlying physics problems

3. **Control Limitations**
   - Can't properly orient ship
   - No realistic maneuvering
   - Arcade-like instead of simulation-quality

### **Target Flight Experience**

1. **Authentic Spaceflight**
   - Ships feel like they have mass and momentum
   - Proper rotation and thrust vectoring
   - Realistic inertia and control authority

2. **Skill-Based Controls**
   - Learning curve for ship mastery
   - Different techniques for different situations
   - Rewarding precision flying

3. **Visceral Sensation**

   - Natural movement feedback
   - Compelling flight dynamics

## ðŸ“‹ **Sprint 21 Focus Areas**

- **Consistent Experience**: Same high-quality flight physics in all scenes
- **Performance Maintained**: 60+ FPS with enhanced physics calculations
