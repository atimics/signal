# Sokol Migration Report: Render and Asset Systems

## 1. Introduction

This document details the architectural changes and technical impact of migrating the engine's rendering and asset management systems from a manual SDL-based pipeline to the Sokol graphics API. The primary goal of this transition was to replace a complex, inefficient, and platform-tethered rendering backend with a modern, cross-platform, and high-performance graphics abstraction layer.

The migration fundamentally shifted our approach from manually implementing 3D logic on a 2D canvas (SDL Renderer) to leveraging the host system's native graphics API (OpenGL, Metal, etc.) through Sokol's unified interface.

## 2. Core Rendering System: `render.h` & `render_3d.c`

The most significant changes occurred within the core rendering module. The previous implementation was a bespoke 3D pipeline built from first principles on top of SDL's 2D-centric functions. The new system is a more standard, shader-based pipeline.

### Key Changes:

*   **Window and Context Management:**
    *   **Before:** The engine relied on `SDL_Window` and `SDL_Renderer` for window creation and drawing context. Initialization and cleanup were handled via `SDL_Init`, `SDL_CreateWindow`, `SDL_CreateRenderer`, and their corresponding `Destroy` and `Quit` functions.
    *   **After:** Windowing and context are now managed by `sokol_app`. The application entry point has shifted from a standard `main` function to `sokol_main`, which registers callbacks (`init_cb`, `frame_cb`, `cleanup_cb`, `event_cb`) to drive the application lifecycle. This removes all direct SDL dependency for windowing.

*   **The Render Loop:**
    *   **Before:** The `render_frame` function was a monolithic block that iterated through entities, performed 3D projection math on the CPU for each vertex, and submitted 2D draw calls (`SDL_RenderDrawLine`, or our own `render_filled_triangle`) to the SDL renderer.
    *   **After:** The render loop is now structured around `sokol_gfx`'s pass-based system. A typical frame involves:
        1.  Starting a render pass with `sg_begin_default_pass`, which clears the screen.
        2.  Applying a single, pre-compiled `sg_pipeline` object that defines the entire render state (shader, depth-test, culling, etc.).
        3.  For each entity, applying resource `sg_bindings` (vertex/index buffers, textures) and `sg_uniforms` (transformation matrices).
        4.  Issuing a single `sg_draw` call per entity.
        5.  Ending the pass with `sg_end_pass` and submitting the frame with `sg_commit`.

*   **Introduction of Shaders:**
    *   **Before:** All vertex transformation, projection, and lighting calculations were performed manually in C code (e.g., `project_3d_to_2d`, `calculate_lighting`). This was slow and inflexible.
    *   **After:** This logic has been moved into GLSL shaders. The C code is now only responsible for uploading transformation matrices (Model, View, Projection) as uniforms. This represents the single most important performance and capability improvement.

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   **Before:** `RenderConfig` was a large struct containing the `SDL_Window`, `SDL_Renderer`, and a global `Camera3D` object.
    *   **After:** `RenderConfig` has been removed or significantly simplified. The render state is now managed by `sokol_gfx` objects (`sg_pipeline`, `sg_shader`), and the camera is handled by the `CameraSystem`, which provides matrices to the shaders.

## 3. Asset Management System: `assets.h` & `assets.c`

The asset system was adapted to support `sokol_gfx`'s resource model. While the file parsing logic remains the same, the representation of assets in memory and their upload to the GPU has completely changed.

### Key Changes:

*   **Resource Representation:**
    *   **Before:** A `Mesh` struct held pointers to CPU-side arrays of vertices and indices. A `Texture` struct would hold an `SDL_Texture`.
    *   **After:** The `Mesh` and `Texture` structs have been updated to store `sokol_gfx` resource handles. For example, a `Mesh` now contains an `sg_buffer` for its vertex data and another for its index data. A `Texture` now holds an `sg_image` handle.

*   **Asset Loading Process:**
    *   **Before:** Loading a mesh involved reading the file into memory. Loading a texture involved using SDL_image (or similar) to create an `SDL_Surface` and then an `SDL_Texture`.
    *   **After:** The file data is still read into CPU memory first. However, an additional, crucial step has been added: the data is uploaded to the GPU by calling `sg_make_buffer` (for meshes) and `sg_make_image` (for textures). The CPU-side copy can optionally be discarded after the upload is complete.

## 4. Summary of Benefits

This migration has yielded substantial benefits:

1.  **Performance:** By moving the entire rendering pipeline to the GPU via shaders, we have unlocked massive performance gains and freed the CPU for game logic.
2.  **Modernity and Simplicity:** The rendering code is now declarative. Instead of telling the engine *how* to draw a triangle, we now describe the *state* needed to render a mesh and submit a draw call. This makes the code cleaner, less error-prone, and easier to understand.
3.  **Portability:** The engine is no longer tied to SDL's rendering backend. Thanks to Sokol, the same code can now run on OpenGL, Metal, WebGPU, and Direct3D with no changes to the rendering logic.
4.  **Extensibility:** Implementing advanced graphics features like shadows, post-processing effects, or instancing is now feasible. These were practically impossible with the previous manual pipeline.

This migration was a critical step in evolving the project from a simple tech demo into a more robust and capable game engine.
