## 4. Racing Tips

### Basic Flying
1. **Start Gentle**: Use small control inputs - the ship is responsive!
2. **Look Ahead**: Camera modes help you see upcoming turns
3. **Use All Axes**: Combine pitch, roll, and yaw for smooth turns
4. **Manage Speed**: Sometimes slower is faster through tight sections

### Advanced Techniques
1. **Banking Turns**: Roll into turns for tighter cornering
2. **Boost Management**: Save boost for straightaways
3. **Threading the Needle**: Use lateral thrust for precise positioning
4. **Altitude Control**: Fly high to see ahead, low for speed

### Environmental Challenges
- **Wind Zones**: Blue particle effects indicate wind - compensate with opposite thrust
- **Fog Banks**: Reduced visibility - memorize the track layout
- **Narrow Passages**: Precision required - reduce speed if needed
- **Moving Obstacles**: Time your approach carefully
