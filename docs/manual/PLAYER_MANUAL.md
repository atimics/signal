# The Ghost Signal: Player Manual

Welcome, Drifter. This manual will help you survive the Graveyard.

## 1. The Premise

Your symbiotic ship is failing. The only thing that can repair its alien core is the **Ghost Signal**, a mysterious broadcast from the heart of a dead fleet. You must follow this signal into the derelicts, salvaging the resources you need to stay alive.

## 2. The Inhabitants of the Graveyard

You are not alone in the Graveyard. Be wary of the other factions:

*   **The Chrome-Barons**: Brutal salvagers who will see you as competition.
*   **The Echo-Scribes**: A cryptic cult of AI who worship the Ghost Signal. They may be willing to trade information, but they are unpredictable.
*   **The Wardens**: The implacable immune system of the Aethelian Fleet. They will see your use of the Ghost Signal as a threat and will try to neutralize you.

## 3. Core Mechanics

### 3.1. The Two States of Play

*   **Strategy (The Resonance Map)**: From the safety of a low-resonance zone, you can use your Resonance Map to analyze the Graveyard, predict enemy movements, and plan your next move.
*   **Execution (In-Ship Piloting)**: Once you've planned your route, you'll pilot your ship directly, using your skills to navigate the treacherous derelicts.

### 3.2. Traversal

*   **The Attraction Drive ("A-Drive")**: This powerful, energy-intensive drive allows you to "surf" along the surfaces of the derelicts at high speed. Mastering the A-Drive is the key to survival.
*   **The Fusion Torch**: For travel in open space, you'll rely on your slower, more efficient fusion torch.

### 3.3. The Resonance Cascade

This is the core gameplay loop:

1.  **Plan**: Use your Resonance Map to identify a target.
2.  **Travel**: Fly to the target location.
3.  **Infiltrate**: Use your A-Drive to navigate the derelict.
4.  **Exploit**: Use your Resonance Attenuator to crack Resonance Locks and acquire **Echoes** (lore and schematics).
5.  **Upgrade**: Use the schematic fragments you find to craft new ship modules and improve your chances of survival.
