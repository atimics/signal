# Guide: Implementing a PBR Rendering System in C with Sokol

This document provides a comprehensive guide to implementing an efficient Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) system in C using the Sokol graphics API. It covers the necessary steps, from setting up the asset pipeline to writing the final rendering code.

## 1. Asset Pipeline for PBR

A robust asset pipeline is the foundation of a PBR workflow. The pipeline should be able to process 3D models and generate the necessary textures and materials for PBR rendering.

### Key Pipeline Stages:

1.  **UV Unwrapping:** The pipeline must be able to generate high-quality UV coordinates for any given mesh. This is a critical step for applying textures correctly. The `trimesh` and `xatlas` Python libraries are excellent choices for this task.
2.  **Texture Generation:** The pipeline should be able to generate the following PBR texture maps:
    *   **Albedo:** The base color of the material.
    *   **Normal:** To add surface detail without increasing polygon count.
    *   **Metallic:** To define the "metalness" of a material.
    *   **Roughness:** To define the microsurface detail of a material.
    *   **Ambient Occlusion (AO):** To add soft shadows and contact shadows.
3.  **Material Generation:** The pipeline should generate a material file (e.g., `.mtl`) that references the generated textures and defines the material's properties.

### Implementation with Python:

The `asset_compiler.py` script in this project is a good example of how to implement such a pipeline. It uses `trimesh` for UV unwrapping and can be extended to generate the full set of PBR textures using libraries like `Pillow` or `OpenCV`.

## 2. Sokol Rendering Backend

Sokol provides a low-level, cross-platform graphics API that is well-suited for high-performance rendering.

### Key Sokol Components for PBR:

1.  **Shaders:** You will need a vertex and fragment shader that implement the PBR lighting model. The fragment shader will be the most complex, as it will need to perform the following calculations:
    *   Sample textures (albedo, normal, metallic, roughness, AO).
    *   Calculate the Cook-Torrance BRDF.
    *   Apply lighting (directional, point, spot).
    *   Apply shadows.
2.  **Pipelines:** You will need to create a `sg_pipeline` that configures the rendering state for your PBR objects. This includes the shader, vertex layout, depth and stencil state, and blend state.
3.  **Bindings:** You will need to create a `sg_bindings` struct to bind the PBR textures and uniform buffers to the shader. For efficiency, you should bind all textures and uniforms in a single call.
4.  **Uniform Buffers:** You will need to create uniform buffers to pass data to the shader, such as the model-view-projection matrix, camera position, and light properties.

### C Implementation (`render_mesh.c`):

The `render_mesh.c` file will need to be re-enabled and refactored to implement the PBR rendering logic. This will involve:

1.  **Loading Shaders:** Load the PBR vertex and fragment shaders from files.
2.  **Creating Pipelines:** Create a `sg_pipeline` for PBR rendering.
3.  **Creating Buffers:** Create vertex, index, and uniform buffers for the meshes.
4.  **Rendering Loop:** In the main rendering loop, for each PBR object:
    *   Update the uniform buffers with the latest data (e.g., MVP matrix).
    *   Apply the pipeline and bindings.
    *   Issue a draw call.

## 3. Advanced Techniques

### Image-Based Lighting (IBL)

IBL is a technique that uses an environment map (a cubemap) to simulate realistic lighting from the surrounding environment. This is a key component of a modern PBR workflow.

### Steps for IBL:

1.  **Generate an Irradiance Map:** Pre-filter the environment map to create an irradiance map. This map stores the diffuse lighting from the environment.
2.  **Generate a Pre-filtered Environment Map:** Pre-filter the environment map at different roughness levels to create a pre-filtered environment map. This map stores the specular lighting from the environment.
3.  **Generate a BRDF Lookup Table (LUT):** Generate a 2D lookup table that stores the result of the BRDF integration. This is used to calculate the specular reflection.
4.  **In the Shader:**
    *   Sample the irradiance map for the diffuse component.
    *   Sample the pre-filtered environment map and the BRDF LUT for the specular component.
    *   Combine the diffuse and specular components to get the final color.

## 4. Conclusion

Implementing a PBR rendering system is a complex but rewarding task. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can create a high-performance, visually stunning rendering system in C with Sokol. The key is to have a robust asset pipeline, a well-designed rendering backend, and a solid understanding of the underlying PBR principles.
