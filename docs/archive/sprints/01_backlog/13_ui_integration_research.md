# Sprint 13 Research: UI Finalization & Engine Polish

This document contains the research and best practices for finalizing the UI system and polishing the engine.

## Research Request

Please investigate the following areas to ensure best practices for *enhancing* the existing Nuklear integration:

### Advanced UI Patterns
1.  **Complex Data Binding**: Best practices for binding complex game state (e.g., nested entity components) to Nuklear widgets.
    *   **Best Practice**: Since Nuklear is an immediate mode UI, there is no automatic data binding. The best approach is to write explicit UI functions (e.g., `ui_render_transform_component`) that take a pointer to the component data and render the appropriate widgets.
2.  **Real-time Graphing**: Techniques for creating efficient real-time performance graphs (e.g., for frame time) in Nuklear.
    *   **Best Practice**: Use a circular buffer (or ring buffer) to store the last N frame times. Pass this buffer directly to `nk_plot_function`. This is highly efficient as it avoids reallocating memory each frame.
    *   **Resource**: [Nuklear Demo Code (GitHub)](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear/blob/master/demo/style.c) (see `nk_plot_function` examples)
3.  **Custom Widget Design**: Feasibility and examples of creating custom, reusable UI widgets with Nuklear's API.
    *   **Best Practice**: Create reusable C functions that encapsulate a group of Nuklear widgets. For example, a `widget_vector3_editor(struct nk_context* ctx, const char* label, Vector3* vector)` function can be created to standardize editing of 3D vectors.

### Performance Optimization
1.  **UI Rendering Costs**: Benchmark data on Nuklear's performance characteristics and optimization techniques for complex UIs.
    *   **Best Practice**: Nuklear is very performant, but its cost scales with the number of widgets. To optimize, use grouping (`nk_group_begin`) and trees (`nk_tree_push`) to collapse inactive UI sections, preventing them from being processed and rendered.
2.  **Memory Footprint**: Typical memory usage patterns and strategies for minimizing UI memory overhead as the UI grows in complexity.
    *   **Best Practice**: Use a fixed-size memory allocator for Nuklear's context. Pre-allocate a reasonably large buffer to prevent reallocations during runtime.
3.  **Draw Call Optimization**: Techniques for batching Nuklear's draw commands to minimize GPU state changes, especially with multiple complex windows.
    *   **Best Practice**: The `sokol_nuklear.h` backend is already highly optimized for this. It batches all UI draw commands into a single vertex buffer and a single draw call per frame. No additional work is needed here.

### API Usage Patterns
1.  **Modern Nuklear API**: Current best practices for Nuklear 4.x+ API usage for advanced features like trees, groups, and popups.
    *   **Best Practice**: Use `nk_tree_push` for hierarchical data (like a scene graph) and `nk_group_begin` for scrollable regions. Use popups (`nk_popup_begin`) for modal dialogs and context menus.
    *   **Resource**: [Nuklear GitHub Repository (Examples)](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear/tree/master/demo)
2.  **State Management**: Best practices for managing the state of a complex, multi-window debug UI.
    *   **Best Practice**: Store the UI state (e.g., window positions, selected entity) in a single, dedicated struct. This struct should be managed separately from the core game state.
