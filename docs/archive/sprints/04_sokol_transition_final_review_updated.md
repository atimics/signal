# Sokol Migration Engineering Report

**Date:** June 29, 2025
**Status:** In Progress
**Author:** System Analysis

## 1. Executive Summary

The migration to the Sokol graphics API has successfully moved the project from a high-risk, dual-implementation state to a stable, single-entry-point application. The core architectural challenge of integrating the Entity-Component-System (ECS) with the Sokol application lifecycle has been overcome. The application now initializes, runs a stable event loop, and shuts down cleanly using the Sokol framework.

However, the project is at a critical juncture. While the foundational integration is complete, no geometry is currently being rendered to the screen. The rendering pipeline, though stable, only clears the framebuffer. The asset system, while functional, has not been updated to produce the GPU-ready resources (`sg_buffer`, `sg_image`) required by `sokol_gfx`.

The immediate and critical priority is to bridge the gap between the CPU-side data (meshes, textures) and the GPU, enabling the rendering of actual geometry. This report provides a detailed analysis of the current state and a phased action plan to complete the migration.

## 2. Current Status Analysis

### 2.1. Key Achievements (游릭 GREEN)

- **Stable Application Entry Point**: The project now runs exclusively through the `sokol_main` entry point in `src/main.c`, completely eliminating the legacy SDL implementation and the associated technical debt of a dual entry point.
- **Successful Sokol Initialization**: The application correctly initializes the Sokol graphics context, window, and event handling system. The build system (`Makefile`) is properly configured for both macOS (Metal) and Linux (OpenGL).
- **Stable Rendering Pipeline**: The `sg_pipeline` object is created and remains valid throughout the application's lifecycle. The previous critical issue of pipeline invalidation has been resolved.
- **Full ECS Integration**: All core game logic systems (Physics, Collision, AI, Camera) are running correctly within the Sokol event loop, demonstrating that the core architecture is compatible with the new backend.
- **Functional Asset & Data Loading**: The asset and data registries successfully load all necessary resources (meshes, materials, entity templates, scenes) from disk into CPU-side data structures.

### 2.2. Critical Deficiencies (游리 YELLOW / 游댮 RED)

- 游댮 **No Visual Output**: The most significant deficiency is the lack of any rendered geometry. The current rendering system only clears the screen to a solid color. This makes it impossible to visually debug or verify the state of the game world.
- 游리 **Asset System-GPU Gap**: The `assets.c` module has not been updated to convert loaded mesh and texture data into the `sg_buffer` and `sg_image` resources required by `sokol_gfx`. This is the primary blocker for implementing geometry rendering.
- 游리 **Disabled UI System**: The UI system, critical for debugging and development, is completely disabled. A new implementation using a Sokol-compatible library (e.g., `sokol_imgui`) is required.
- 游리 **Placeholder Shader System**: While shaders are loaded from files, the system is basic. A more robust system for managing shader permutations, uniforms, and material properties will be needed for a full PBR pipeline.

## 3. Critical Analysis & Risk Assessment

The project is currently in a state of **functional blindness**. The simulation is running correctly, but the lack of visual feedback presents several risks:

- **Loss of Momentum**: Without visible progress, it can be difficult to maintain development momentum and morale.
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Debugging the state of the simulation is currently limited to console output, which is inefficient and insufficient for a 3D application.
- **Compounding Technical Debt**: Deferring the asset pipeline migration and UI implementation will only make these tasks more complex as other parts of the engine evolve.

The overall risk has been downgraded from "High" to **"Medium"**, as the primary architectural hurdles have been cleared. The remaining work is more linear and implementation-focused, but it must be addressed systematically to avoid stagnation.

## 4. Detailed Action Plan & Recommendations

The following phased plan is recommended to complete the migration in an orderly and efficient manner.

### Phase 1: Foundational Rendering (1-2 Weeks)

**Goal**: To get 3D geometry rendering on the screen as quickly as possible.

1.  **Render a Test Triangle (1 Day)**
    - **Action**: Re-enable the existing test triangle rendering code in `render_frame()`.
    - **Rationale**: This provides an immediate, simple visual confirmation that the core rendering pipeline is working correctly.

2.  **Create a `Renderable` Component (2-3 Days)**
    - **Action**: Create a new `Renderable` component that contains the `sg_buffer` and `sg_image` resources for a mesh.
    - **Rationale**: This will establish a clear link between an entity and its GPU resources.

3.  **Implement a Simple Mesh Renderer (3-5 Days)**
    - **Action**: Create a system that iterates over entities with a `Renderable` component and issues `sg_draw` calls.
    - **Rationale**: This will provide a basic, but functional, mesh rendering system.

### Phase 2: Asset-to-GPU Pipeline (2-3 Weeks)

**Goal**: To fully migrate the asset system to produce GPU-ready resources.

1.  **Migrate Mesh Data (1 Week)**
    - **Action**: Modify `assets.c` to create `sg_buffer` objects from loaded mesh data.
    - **Rationale**: This will enable the rendering of actual mesh geometry.

2.  **Migrate Texture Data (1 Week)**
    - **Action**: Use a library like `stb_image` to load texture data and create `sg_image` objects.
    - **Rationale**: This will enable the rendering of textured meshes.

3.  **Update Rendering System (Ongoing)**
    - **Action**: Update the rendering system to use the new GPU resources from the `Renderable` component.
    - **Rationale**: This will complete the asset-to-GPU pipeline.

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Ongoing)

**Goal**: To restore and enhance the engine's feature set.

1.  **Camera System Integration**
    - **Action**: Implement proper camera switching and control using the existing ECS camera entities.
    - **Rationale**: This will restore the multi-camera functionality.

2.  **PBR Shader Implementation**
    - **Action**: Implement a physically-based rendering pipeline with support for normal maps, specular maps, and other PBR properties.
    - **Rationale**: This will significantly improve the visual quality of the engine.

3.  **UI System Integration**
    - **Action**: Integrate a Sokol-compatible UI library like `sokol_imgui`.
    - **Rationale**: This will restore the debug overlay and provide a foundation for a more advanced UI.
