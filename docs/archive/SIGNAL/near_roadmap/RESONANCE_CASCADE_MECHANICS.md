#### Scientific Grounding
```c
// Gravitational field interaction modeling
typedef struct {
    Vector3 position;           // Object position in space
    double mass;               // Gravitational mass
    Vector3 velocity;          // Current motion vector
    double gravitational_constant; // Local G variation
} GravitationalBody;

typedef struct {
    double base_frequency;     // Primary harmonic frequency
    double harmonic_series[8]; // Overtone structure
