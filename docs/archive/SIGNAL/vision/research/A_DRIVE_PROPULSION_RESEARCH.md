## Real and Fictional Physics Inspirations

### Gravity Assist Mechanics
The A-Drive concept draws from real spacecraft **gravity assist** maneuvers, where vessels use planetary gravity to boost speed without additional fuel. The closer a spacecraft swings by a massive object (avoiding collision), the greater the velocity change achieved. This "more speed when nearer to mass" principle forms the A-Drive's core effect.

### Oberth Effect
Related to gravity assist is the **Oberth effect**, where rocket burns yield more energy when performed at high speed near a gravity well. The A-Drive exploits similar principles—using intense gravitational potential at low altitude for enhanced propulsion efficiency.

### Magnetic Levitation Analogy
Maglev trains achieve frictionless high speeds by riding magnetic fields close to their guide rails. The A-Drive operates similarly, using massive bodies' gravitational fields as propulsion mediums—effectively "pushing against" gravitational structures for enhanced speed.

### Ground Effect Physics
Aerodynamic ground effect allows aircraft to fly faster and more efficiently near surfaces due to improved lift-to-drag ratios. The A-Drive creates a space-time equivalent—forming localized field distortions between ship and surface that reduce resistance and enhance thrust.

## Technical Implementation Framework

### Proximity Detection System
```c
// Pseudocode for A-Drive proximity detection
RaycastHit surface_hit;
bool surface_detected = raycast_downward(ship.position, &surface_hit, detection_range);

if (surface_detected) {
    Vector3 surface_normal = surface_hit.normal;
    float proximity_factor = calculate_proximity_boost(surface_hit.distance);
    
    // Align ship orientation to surface
    Quaternion target_rotation = align_to_surface(surface_normal);
    ship.rotation = smooth_rotate(ship.rotation, target_rotation, alignment_speed);
    
    // Apply speed boost based on proximity
    ship.max_speed = base_speed * (1.0f + boost_multiplier * proximity_factor);
    
    // Apply gravitational attraction
    apply_surface_gravity(surface_normal, proximity_factor);
}
