- ⚠️ Windows (community supported)

### Build Requirements
- Clang 12+ or GCC 9+
- Make 4.0+
- OpenGL 3.3+
- SDL2 (via Sokol)

## Known Issues

### Critical (Sprint 24 Focus)
- MicroUI rendering pipeline produces no visible output
- UI event handling timing issues

### Minor
- Visual thruster effects not rendering (cosmetic)
- Gamepad hot-plug occasionally needs restart
- Some debug output still in release builds

### Won't Fix
- Neural network input processing (removed for simplicity)
- Complex multi-body ship physics (simplified design chosen)

## Development Highlights

### Sprint 24 Critical Issue
The MicroUI system is properly initialized and processing frames, but generates zero vertices for rendering. This completely blocks all UI development and must be resolved before gameplay features can have proper interfaces.

### Recent Achievements (Sprint 23)
- Same-day sprint completion (July 3, 2025)
- 98% test coverage achieved
- Build system issues completely resolved
- Bonus scripted flight system implemented

### Strategic Pivot
Sprint 24 was originally planned as Canyon Racing Prototype but pivoted to address critical UI issues discovered through log analysis. Canyon Racing moved to Sprint 25.
