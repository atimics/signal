# Project Status: CGame Engine

**Last Updated**: June 30, 2025

This document provides a real-time overview of the CGame engine development status.

## Current Focus

**Phase 2: COMPLETE - Asset Pipeline & Engine Integration**

The project has successfully completed the core asset pipeline and engine integration work:

*   âœ… **Asset Pipeline**: Complete UV-mapped mesh generation with SVG editing workflow
*   âœ… **Binary Compilation**: 40-50% file size reduction with ~10x faster loading
*   âœ… **Engine Integration**: All 7 meshes rendering with proper UV textures
*   âœ… **Mesh Viewer**: Web-based 3D preview with texture display and interactive navigation
*   âœ… **Scene System**: Logo scene transitions, camera cycling, and scene scripting functional

## Next Active Sprint

**[Sprint 19: Performance Optimization & Polish](./sprints/active/sprint_19_performance_optimization.md)**

*   **Goal**: Optimize rendering performance, implement LOD system, and polish the user experience
*   **Priority**: High
*   **Estimated Duration**: 4-6 days

## Strategic Outlook

The project is transitioning to **Phase 3: Performance & Polish**, as outlined in the [Strategic Plan](./STRATEGIC_PLAN.md).

*   **Phase 1: Foundational Stability**: âœ… **COMPLETE**
*   **Phase 2: Asset Pipeline & Integration**: âœ… **COMPLETE**
*   **Phase 3: Performance & Polish**: ðŸ”„ **ACTIVE**
*   **Phase 4: Gameplay and Content Tools**: ðŸ“‹ **UPCOMING**

## Key Metrics
