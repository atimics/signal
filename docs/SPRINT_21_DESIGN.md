# Sprint 21: Resonance Cascade Gameplay Implementation

**Sprint**: 21 - Core Gameplay Systems  
**Focus**: Resonance Cascade mechanics implementation  
**Date**: July 2, 2025  
**Priority**: High - Transform engine into playable game  
**Status**: DESIGN PHASE

## üéØ **Sprint Goals**

Transform the SIGNAL engine from a visual demonstration platform into a functional game by implementing the core **Resonance Cascade** gameplay loop. This sprint focuses on creating the fundamental player interaction mechanics that define the game's unique exploration and puzzle-solving experience.

## üìã **Sprint Foundation**

### **Current Engine State** ‚úÖ
- Professional visual quality with material-based rendering
- Advanced lighting system with scene-specific presets
- Comprehensive ECS architecture with 80,000+ entities/ms performance
- Robust asset pipeline with binary compilation and validation
- Scene system aligned with FTL navigation game vision
- Configuration management for flexible development workflow

### **Game Vision Alignment**
Based on `docs/project/GAME_VISION.md`, the Resonance Cascade is the core gameplay loop:
1. **Plan** (Resonance Map): Analyze the Graveyard and identify targets
2. **Travel** (Fusion Torch): Navigate to derelict locations
3. **Infiltrate** (A-Drive): High-speed exploration through derelict interiors
4. **Exploit** (Resonance Cracking): Use Echoes to unlock secrets
5. **Upgrade** (Schematic Fragmentation): Craft new ship modules from discoveries

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Design**

### **Core Components to Implement**

#### 1. Echo Component
```c
typedef struct {
    enum ResonanceType type;        // Engineering, Security, Navigation, etc.
    float stability_cost;           // Resource cost to maintain
    char fragment_id[64];          // Link to lore system
    float signal_strength;         // Quality/power of the echo
    bool is_corrupted;             // Damaged echoes with risks
    uint32_t discovery_timestamp;  // When player found this echo
} Echo;
```

#### 2. Attenuator Component (Player Ship)
```c
typedef struct {
    EntityID slotted_echoes[MAX_ECHO_SLOTS];  // Currently equipped echoes
    uint32_t slot_count;                      // Available slots (upgradeable)
    enum ResonanceType active_resonance;      // Current tuned frequency
    float total_stability_drain;              // Resource consumption
    float resonance_efficiency;               // Tuning quality modifier
    bool auto_tune_enabled;                   // Automatic resonance switching
} Attenuator;
```

#### 3. Resonance Lock Component (World Objects)
```c
typedef struct {
    enum ResonanceType required_type;    // Required resonance to activate
    float activation_threshold;          // Minimum signal strength needed
    bool is_activated;                   // Current activation state
    bool is_visible;                     // Visible to current resonance
    EntityID unlocked_entity;            // What this lock reveals/enables
