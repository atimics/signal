## Gravitational Resonance Theory

### The Physics Foundation
FTL travel occurs through **gravitational field resonance** - by precisely tuning to the harmonic frequencies generated by gravitational interactions between celestial bodies, ships can instantaneously translate between resonance points.

#### Scientific Grounding
```c
// Gravitational field interaction modeling
typedef struct {
    Vector3 position;           // Object position in space
    double mass;               // Gravitational mass
    Vector3 velocity;          // Current motion vector
    double gravitational_constant; // Local G variation
} GravitationalBody;

typedef struct {
    double base_frequency;     // Primary harmonic frequency
    double harmonic_series[8]; // Overtone structure
    Vector3 resonance_point;   // Spatial location of maximum resonance
