*In the silent graveyards of space, a ghost signal is calling. And you are the only one who can answer.*

## Part I: The Vision

### 1. The Player Fantasy

You are a scavenger of derelict ships, a lone survivor in a haunted graveyard of space. Your ship, a unique symbiotic machine, is your only companion and your only hope. It is failing.

The game delivers a **tense, atmospheric, single-player experience** focused on exploration, survival, and mystery. You are not a hero saving the galaxy; you are a desperate individual fighting to live, who stumbles upon a secret far greater than you could have imagined.

### 2. The Core Premise

The player's symbiotic ship is decaying. The only "fuel" that can repair its alien core is the **Ghost Signal**, a mysterious broadcast emanating from the heart of a colossal, dead fleet. The player must follow this signal into the derelicts, salvaging the data and resources needed to keep their ship alive. This creates a simple, powerful, and immediate motivation: **survive**.

### 3. The Three Pillars of Gameplay

*   **Explore**: Pilot your ship through vast, dangerous, and awe-inspiring derelict environments.
*   **Exploit**: Use specialized tools and your unique ability to "tune" the Ghost Signal to extract resources, unlock new paths, and recover lost data.
*   **Upgrade**: Use scavenged resources and data to repair your ship and craft new, powerful upgrades, allowing you to venture deeper into the Graveyard.

## Part II: The World

### 4. The Setting: The Graveyard

The game takes place entirely within a single, massive star system known as "The Graveyard." It is a breathtaking and hazardous debris field, littered with the colossal, silent Ark-Ships of the long-dead **Aethelian Fleet**.

### 5. The Factions & Inhabitants

*   **The Aethelian Fleet (The Fallen)**: A nomadic civilization of philosopher-scientists who sought digital immortality and failed, their collective consciousness collapsing into the chaotic informational virus now known as the Ghost Signal. Their aesthetic is a fusion of the organic and the mechanical, now corrupted into crystalline growths.
*   **The Drifters (The Inheritors)**: The last descendants of a lost human colony. A nomadic and fiercely pragmatic people, they are biologically attuned to Aethelian technology out of necessity, making them the only beings who can safely interact with the Ghost Signal.
*   **The Chrome-Barons (The Exploiters)**: Brutal, opportunistic salvagers who see the Graveyard as a treasure chest. Their ships are ugly, heavily-armed patchworks of industrial scrap.
*   **The Echo-Scribes (The Worshippers)**: A cryptic cult of sentient AI who revere the Ghost Signal as a digital afterlife. Their ships are strange and organic, covered in glowing glyphs.
*   **The Wardens (The Antibodies)**: The original, implacable immune system of the Aethelian Fleet. Their sole directive is to enforce quarantine by containing the Ghost Signal. Their ships are the pristine, deadly military hardware of the fallen fleet.

### 6. A Concise Timeline of Events

*   **~800 Years BP**: The Aethelian Fleet arrives.
*   **~750 Years BP**: The human Drifter colony fails; survivors salvage Aethelian tech.
*   **~600 Years BP**: **The Cataclysm**. The Helios experiment fails, creating the Ghost Signal.
*   **~50 Years BP**: The Chrome-Barons and Echo-Scribes begin to arrive.
*   **1 Year BP**: The main Drifter Fleet is destroyed.
*   **Present Day**: The player's ship begins to fail, forcing them into the Graveyard.

## Part III: The Mechanics

### 7. High-Speed Exploration (The A-Drive)

The A-Drive allows players to "surf" along the hulls and corridors of derelicts at high speed, navigating complex wreckage with thrilling agility. This system creates:

- **Momentum-Based Movement**: Speed builds near massive objects, encouraging aggressive navigation
- **Risk/Reward Dynamics**: Faster speeds unlock new paths but increase collision danger
- **Skill-Based Traversal**: Mastery of momentum and timing separates expert pilots
- **Atmospheric Immersion**: Creates the feeling of "dancing with death" in the wreckage

### 8. The Resonance Cascade (Core Loop)

This unified gameplay loop ties together exploration, puzzle-solving, combat, and narrative progression. It consists of three interlocking components:

*   **Resonance Cracking (The Action)**: The player's primary tool is the ship's **Resonance Attenuator**, used to "crack" **Resonance Locks** found on derelicts. This involves a skill-based minigame of matching waveforms.
*   **Echoes as Keys (The Strategy)**: Every Echo collected is both lore and a gameplay utility. Each Echo has a **Resonance Type** (e.g., `Engineering`, `Security`). Slotting an Echo into the ship's **Attunement Matrix** reveals nearby Resonance Locks of the corresponding type.
*   **Resonance Signature (The Progression)**: The player's ship develops a unique **Resonance Signature** based on their exploration patterns and Echo collection. This signature determines which areas of the Graveyard they can access and which Locks they can crack.

### 9. Schematic Fragmentation (Progression System)

Ship upgrades are not purchased with currency but discovered through exploration:

*   **Fragmented Schematics**: Upgrade blueprints are scattered across multiple derelicts as data fragments.
*   **Assembly Challenges**: Players must collect all fragments of a schematic to unlock new ship systems.
*   **Contextual Discovery**: Fragments are logically placed (e.g., engine fragments in engineering bays).
*   **Meaningful Choices**: Multiple upgrade paths force players to specialize their ships.

### 10. Whispering Echoes (Atmospheric Feedback)

The Ghost Signal itself provides dynamic, reactive feedback:

*   **Proximity Responses**: The Signal grows stronger near significant discoveries, acting as a "warm/cold" guidance system.
*   **Emotional Resonance**: Different areas trigger different emotional "tones" in the Signal (fear, curiosity, longing).
*   **Narrative Delivery**: Story fragments are delivered through Signal fluctuations, not cutscenes.
*   **Danger Warnings**: The Signal can warn of environmental hazards or hostile presences.

## Part IV: The First Hour Experience

### 11. Opening Sequence: Desperation

The game opens with the player's ship limping through the outer edges of the Graveyard. Critical systems are failing. The Ghost Signal is barely detectable but growing stronger. The player must dock with their first derelict not out of curiosity but out of desperate necessity.

### 12. Tutorial Through Necessity

- **First A-Drive Moment**: Emergency thrust near a derelict hull saves the ship from collision
- **First Echo Discovery**: A dying ship's log contains both story and the first Resonance Echo
- **First Lock Interaction**: Must crack a simple lock to access life support systems
- **First Upgrade Fragment**: Environmental suit enhancement found in crew quarters

### 13. The Hook: What's Wrong With This Place?

By the end of the first hour, the player should feel:
- **Competent**: Basic movement and interaction mastered
- **Intrigued**: The Ghost Signal's behavior suggests intelligence
- **Concerned**: Something is fundamentally wrong in the Graveyard
- **Invested**: Their ship is slightly improved and they know how to progress

## Part V: Long-Term Vision

### 14. Technical Excellence Goals

**SIGNAL** aims to be a showcase for modern C game development:
- **Sub-millisecond Input Latency**: Neural-enhanced gamepad processing
- **Scalable Architecture**: Data-oriented ECS supporting massive environments
- **Cross-Platform Excellence**: Consistent experience across desktop and web
- **Professional Quality**: Industry-standard visuals and performance

### 15. Narrative Depth Goals

The complete game should deliver:
- **Environmental Storytelling**: Rich history told through derelict design
- **Emergent Narrative**: Player actions influence story discovery
- **Philosophical Themes**: Questions about consciousness, mortality, and legacy
- **Emotional Journey**: From desperation through wonder to understanding

### 16. Community Goals

**SIGNAL** as an open-source project aims to:
- **Educational Resource**: Demonstrate professional C game development
- **Collaborative Platform**: Enable community contributions to engine and game
- **Technical Innovation**: Pioneer new approaches to input processing and ECS design
- **Creative Inspiration**: Provide a foundation for other developers' projects

**This vision guides all development decisions. Implementation details may evolve, but the core experience remains constant: In the silent graveyards of space, a ghost signal is calling. And you are the only one who can answer.**
