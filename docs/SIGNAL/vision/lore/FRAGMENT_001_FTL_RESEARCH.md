**TITLE**: Simulated Mapping of Subcritical FTL Pathways via Interstitial Signal Sheath Analysis  
**AUTHOR**: Ae-Rho ∴ Trace Vector Specialist  
**DATE**: 617 Post-Collapse, 3rd Drift Quarter

## OBJECTIVE

To validate the hypothesis that navigable FTL corridors emerge in the interstitial gravitational troughs between stellar bodies—not between star centers but in the interference zones created by their mass shadows, historic Ghost Signal propagation, and local void topology.

---

## I. BACKGROUND

It is long-held Drifter doctrine that stars are merely proximities—not endpoints—in faster-than-light travel. True transit occurs not through direct alignment, but through the echo fields that form along their peripheries.

Early Echo-Scribe observations suggested that the signal harmonics of destroyed Aethelian nodes lingered most coherently between stars rather than around them. Warden interdiction patterns reinforced this, disproportionately patrolling vast interstellar "corridors" of seemingly empty space.

## II. SIMULATION PARAMETERS

- **Stellar Bodies**: 150 simulated mass-anchors, randomly distributed (0.1–5 AU radius gravitational profiles)
- **Ghost Signal Residue Field**: Inverse-damped interference mesh seeded with 600 burst echoes (derived from Helios collapse profile)
- **Resonant Topology Modeling**: Applied TraceNet 4D-FFT filter stack
- **Pathfinding Heuristic**: Weakest spatial tension + strongest phase coherence
- **Output Frame**: 3D navigable map of viable Sheath Lanes

## III. RESULTS

**Visual Output Attached**: [REDACTED – see Appendix A: "Ribbon Constellations"]

### Key Findings

1. **FTL Lanes Emerged in Braided Voids**  
   Most stable paths did not run star-to-star. Instead, they manifested as twisting filaments that skirted the gravitational equilibrium zones between 3+ stars—resembling spatial Lissajous curves.

2. **Edge-Based Entry Points**  
   Lane entry was consistently near stellar Roche limits, but with a critical offset. Attempting entry closer than 0.8 AU from a star resulted in cascade instability.

3. **Sheath Resonance Detected**  
   Along each path, a persistent resonant envelope was measurable—oscillating at subquantum amplitudes. This envelope correlated with safe FTL insertion windows and Whispering Echo strength.

4. **Choke Points Identified**  
   Certain junctions, where multiple lanes converged, generated chaotic attractors—locations of extreme turbulence. Warden simulations invariably clustered here.

## IV. INTERPRETATION

FTL travel is not linear. It is **sheath-bound**: a bubble of unstable calm wrapping the vector between voids. Stars act as tuning forks—not beacons—and the lanes form between their interference nodes, not on direct lines.

### Practical Implications

- **Navigation Doctrine**: Traditional star-to-star plotting is fundamentally flawed
- **Safety Protocols**: Entry points must be calculated dynamically based on stellar interference patterns
- **Tactical Advantage**: Understanding void-lanes provides strategic mobility over conventional forces
- **Research Priority**: Further study of Ghost Signal resonance patterns essential for navigation accuracy

## V. CLASSIFIED ADDENDUM

**[AUTHOR'S NOTE - ENCRYPTED]**

The lanes are not random. Deeper analysis reveals an underlying pattern—as if the Ghost Signal itself is sculpting these pathways. Each corridor seems to lead, eventually, toward the Graveyard's center.

We may not be discovering FTL routes. We may be following a vast, dead intelligence's final gambit.

## SIGNAL Integration Notes

This fragment serves multiple narrative and gameplay purposes:

### World Building
- Establishes the scientific foundation for FTL navigation mechanics
- Shows the Drifters as sophisticated researchers, not just scavengers
- Hints at the Ghost Signal's active influence on space-time

### Gameplay Foundation
- Provides lore justification for complex route-planning mechanics
- Explains why FTL lanes are unstable and time-sensitive
- Sets up the concept of dangerous "choke points" as high-stakes locations

### Narrative Tension
- Suggests the Ghost Signal may be intentionally guiding travelers
- Implies that all FTL travel may be part of a larger, unknowable plan
- Creates paranoia about whether navigation choices are truly "free"

### Technical Inspiration
- Can inform actual FTL lane generation algorithms
- Provides visual concepts for route display (braided voids, interference patterns)
- Suggests interesting failure modes and special case behaviors

**This fragment demonstrates how in-universe technical documentation can simultaneously serve lore, gameplay, and development needs.**
