## ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOVERY RECORD - PROJECT LIGHTHOUSE

**Date**: [CLASSIFIED]  
**Site**: THE GRAVEYARD - PRIMARY DERELICT DESIGNATION "MONUMENT"  
**Lead Archaeologist**: Dr. Elena Vasquez, Imperial Archaeological Division  
**Security Clearance**: OBSIDIAN LEVEL

---

### DISCOVERY SUMMARY

The object designated "Monument" by civilian populations is not a singular derelict ship, but rather a **network terminal** in what we now understand to be the most sophisticated interstellar infrastructure ever constructed.

### THE AETHELIAN NETWORK - FULL ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT

#### Network Scope
Our deep-scan analyses reveal **Monument** contains coordinate data for 847 additional network nodes across 12 star systems. Each "derelict" was positioned with astronomical precision to create a gravitational resonance grid enabling instantaneous interstellar travel.

#### Original Civilization Profile
- **Designation**: Aethelian Collective
- **Technology Level**: Post-scarcity, gravitational manipulation mastery  
- **Network Purpose**: Interstellar communication and transportation infrastructure
- **Collapse Timeline**: Approximately 600 years ago
- **Collapse Cause**: Consciousness transfer experiment failure ("Helios Incident")

#### Current Network Status
- **Active Nodes**: 23 confirmed, 156 probable
- **Dormant Nodes**: 668 mapped but non-functional
- **Network Integrity**: 2.7% of original capacity
- **Restoration Potential**: FEASIBLE with sufficient resources

### THE GHOST SIGNAL - TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

The "Ghost Signal" emanating from Monument is **automated network maintenance protocol**. Analysis reveals:
- Continuous attempts to reestablish connections with dormant nodes
- Navigation coordinates and authentication protocols
- System diagnostic reports and repair instructions
- **CRITICAL**: Full network restoration procedures

### IMPERIAL IMPLICATIONS

**Classification Rationale**: Public knowledge of the network's true scope would:
1. Destabilize current imperial control of interstellar shipping
2. Create massive civilian unrest demanding access to ancient infrastructure  
3. Trigger resource conflicts over network node locations
4. Undermine the economic foundation of the current galactic order

**Recommended Action**: Maintain Monument's status as "archaeological curiosity" while developing classified restoration program under military oversight.

### PROJECT LIGHTHOUSE OBJECTIVES

#### Phase 1 - Reconnaissance (CURRENT)
- Map all network nodes using Monument's coordinate database
- Assess restoration feasibility for priority nodes
- Develop technologies for network activation and control
- Maintain absolute secrecy regarding network's true purpose

#### Phase 2 - Selective Restoration (PLANNED)
- Activate limited network connections under Imperial control
- Establish military-exclusive FTL transportation grid
- Develop counter-measures against unauthorized network access
- Create cover stories for increased activity around "derelict sites"

#### Phase 3 - Strategic Deployment (CLASSIFIED)
- Deploy restored network for rapid military logistics
- Use network control to isolate rebellious systems
- Establish permanent Imperial supremacy over galactic transportation
- **ABSOLUTE PRIORITY**: Prevent civilian or rebel access to network technology

### SECURITY PROTOCOLS

**Personnel Awareness**: Only Obsidian-clearance archaeological staff aware of network's true scope
**Cover Operations**: All network sites maintained as "routine archaeological surveys"
**Counter-Intelligence**: Active monitoring for independent discovery of network connections
**Contingency Planning**: Destruction protocols prepared for network nodes if control is compromised

### CURRENT THREAT ASSESSMENT

**Rebellion Activity**: Increased scavenging operations near Monument
**Risk Level**: MODERATE - Rebels seeking salvage, not archaeological significance
**Recommended Response**: Continue monitoring, maintain cover story
**Escalation Triggers**: Any rebel activity suggesting network awareness

**ADDENDUM - PERSONAL NOTE (Dr. Vasquez)**

The Aethelians built something extraordinary - a network that could have connected every inhabited world in the galaxy. Instead of using this knowledge to benefit all citizens, we're weaponizing it for imperial control. 

I've hidden additional technical data in the Monument's lower levels. Perhaps someone with pure motives will find it someday and use this technology as it was intended - to bring worlds together, not to control them.
