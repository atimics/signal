## Welcome, Drifter

Your symbiotic ship is failing. The only thing that can repair its alien core is the **Ghost Signal**, a mysterious broadcast from the heart of a dead fleet. You must follow this signal into the derelicts, salvaging the resources you need to stay alive.

This manual covers the current implementation of SIGNAL. Features marked as "Coming Soon" are planned but not yet available.

## üöÄ Flight Mechanics

### Basic Flight Model
SIGNAL features a **6-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) flight system** with realistic physics:

- **Thrust Vector Control**: Your ship responds to force application in world space
- **Momentum Conservation**: Velocity accumulates realistically based on mass and applied forces
- **Coordinated Flight**: Banking turns combine roll and yaw for natural maneuvering
- **Atmospheric Feedback**: Ship responds differently in various environments

### Advanced Input Processing ‚úÖ NEW
Your gamepad input is enhanced by an advanced processing system:

- **Statistical Calibration**: Automatic dead-zone adjustment and center drift compensation
- **Noise Filtering**: Smooth input without added latency
- **Controller Adaptation**: Improved experience on any controller, especially worn/damaged hardware
- **Zero Configuration**: Works immediately with invisible 10-second calibration

### A-Drive Mechanics üîÑ COMING SOON
The signature **Attraction Drive** system will enable:
- High-speed surface skimming along derelict hulls
- Gravitational field interaction for enhanced maneuverability
- Risk/reward gameplay through proximity-based speed boosts
- Skill-based traversal through complex wreckage

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Controller Not Responding
1. Ensure Xbox controller is connected and recognized by system
2. Check that no other applications are using the controller
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting the controller
4. Restart the game to re-initialize input systems

#### Performance Issues
1. Check debug UI (~ key) for performance metrics
2. Ensure graphics drivers are up to date
3. Close other resource-intensive applications
4. Consider reducing scene complexity if framerate drops

#### Scene Loading Problems
1. Verify all game files are present and intact
2. Check console output (if available) for error messages
3. Try switching to a different scene with Tab key
4. Restart game to reset scene system

#### Build/Compilation Issues
If building from source:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. Use `make clean` followed by `make` to rebuild
3. Check that development tools are properly configured
4. Review build output for specific error messages
