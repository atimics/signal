## Overview

SIGNAL's engine architecture demonstrates modern C game development principles through a data-oriented Entity-Component-System (ECS) design. The architecture prioritizes performance, maintainability, and scalability while providing a solid foundation for complex gameplay systems.

## Core Architecture Principles

### Data-Oriented Design
SIGNAL follows data-oriented design principles throughout:

- **Cache-Friendly Memory Layout**: Components stored in contiguous arrays for optimal CPU cache utilization
- **Batch Processing**: Systems process components of the same type together for maximum efficiency
- **Minimal Indirection**: Direct data access patterns reduce pointer chasing and memory stalls
- **Predictable Performance**: Consistent execution patterns enable reliable performance characteristics

### Entity-Component-System (ECS)
The core architectural pattern separating data, logic, and identity:

```c
// Entity: Unique identifier with component mask
typedef uint32_t EntityID;

// Component: Pure data structure
typedef struct {
    Vector3 position;
    Quaternion rotation;
    Vector3 scale;
    bool dirty;
} Transform;

// System: Pure logic operating on components
void physics_system_update(World* world, float delta_time);
```
