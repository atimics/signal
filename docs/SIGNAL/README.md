# SIGNAL - Documentation Hub

**In the silent graveyards of space, a ghost signal is calling. And you are the only one who can answer.**

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for **SIGNAL** - a high-performance, data-oriented 3D game engine and the foundation for "The Ghost Signal" space exploration game.

**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Current Status**: Sprint 22 - Advanced Input Processing (Phase 1 Complete)  
**Engine Version**: 0.4.0-dev

## üéØ Documentation Organization

This documentation is organized into four main categories to separate vision from implementation, ensuring clear communication and efficient development:

### üìñ [Vision Documents](vision/)
High-level game design, world-building, and long-term strategic direction. These documents define what SIGNAL will become.

- **[Game Vision & World Bible](vision/GAME_VISION.md)** - Complete game design and narrative foundation
- **[Lore & Worldbuilding](vision/lore/)** - The Ghost Signal universe and narrative elements
- **[Strategic Research](vision/research/)** - Long-term technical and gameplay research

### üéØ [Near Roadmap](near_roadmap/) (Max 3 Items)
Immediate next steps and priorities. These are the concrete, actionable items that bridge vision to implementation.

- **[Phase 2: Neural Input Processing](near_roadmap/NEURAL_INPUT_PROCESSING.md)** - ML-enhanced gamepad controls
- **[Gameplay Systems Implementation](near_roadmap/RESONANCE_CASCADE_MECHANICS.md)** - Core game loop mechanics
- **[Audio Integration](near_roadmap/AUDIO_SYSTEM.md)** - Sound effects and atmospheric audio

### ‚ö° [Active Sprint](active_sprint/)
Current development focus with detailed implementation specifications and progress tracking.

- **[Sprint 22 Status](active_sprint/SPRINT_22_STATUS.md)** - Current sprint progress and blockers
- **[Technical Implementation](active_sprint/SPRINT_22_IMPLEMENTATION.md)** - Detailed technical specifications
- **[Test Results](active_sprint/SPRINT_22_TESTS.md)** - Test status and validation progress

### ‚úÖ [Completed Manual](completed_manual/)
Implemented features, stable APIs, and production-ready documentation. These represent the current reality of SIGNAL.

- **[Engine Architecture](completed_manual/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - ECS system and core engine design
- **[Developer Guide](completed_manual/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)** - Development practices and coding standards
- **[Player Manual](completed_manual/PLAYER_MANUAL.md)** - Gameplay controls and user interface
- **[API Reference](completed_manual/API_REFERENCE.md)** - Complete function documentation
- **[Build System](completed_manual/BUILD_SYSTEM.md)** - Compilation and deployment guide

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Players
1. Read the **[Player Manual](completed_manual/PLAYER_MANUAL.md)** for controls and gameplay
2. Check **[Build Instructions](completed_manual/BUILD_SYSTEM.md)** to compile and run

### For Developers
1. Start with the **[Developer Guide](completed_manual/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)** for coding standards
2. Review **[Engine Architecture](completed_manual/ARCHITECTURE.md)** for system understanding
3. Check **[Active Sprint](active_sprint/)** for current development priorities

### For Contributors
1. Review **[Game Vision](vision/GAME_VISION.md)** to understand the project direction
2. Check **[Near Roadmap](near_roadmap/)** for upcoming priorities
3. Look at **[Active Sprint](active_sprint/)** for immediate contribution opportunities

## üìä Current Project Status

**üü¢ Engine Foundation**: Solid, production-ready ECS architecture with high-performance rendering  
**üü° Input System**: Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 (neural processing) in progress  
**üî¥ Gameplay Systems**: Core mechanics not yet implemented (planned for next sprint)  

### Recent Achievements
- ‚úÖ Advanced statistical input calibration system
- ‚úÖ Kalman filtering for smooth gamepad input
- ‚úÖ Neural-ready architecture with MRAC safety shell
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite with all tests passing
- ‚úÖ Professional-quality 3D rendering pipeline

### Current Priorities
1. **Fix Build Issues**: Resolve enum conflicts and deprecated code
2. **Neural Input Processing**: Complete Phase 2 ML implementation
3. **Gameplay Mechanics**: Implement Resonance Cascade core loop

## üéØ Design Philosophy

**SIGNAL** follows these core principles:

- **Data-Oriented Design**: Performance-first C99 with ECS architecture
- **Quality-First Development**: Comprehensive testing and documentation
- **Vision-Driven**: Clear separation between aspirational design and current implementation
- **Community-Focused**: Open development with clear contribution pathways

## üìù Documentation Standards

### Organization Principles
- **Vision vs. Reality**: Clear separation between future goals and current implementation
- **Actionable Content**: Every document has a clear purpose and next steps
- **Maintenance**: Regular updates with status indicators and timestamps
- **Cross-References**: Logical navigation between related documents

### Update Protocols
- **Vision Documents**: Updated only for major design changes
- **Near Roadmap**: Updated at sprint boundaries (max 3 items)
- **Active Sprint**: Updated throughout sprint development
- **Completed Manual**: Updated when features reach production quality
