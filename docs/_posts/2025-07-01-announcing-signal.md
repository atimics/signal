# Announcing SIGNAL: A New, Open-Source 3D Game Engine

**In the silent graveyards of space, a ghost signal is calling. And you are the only one who can answer.**

We are thrilled to announce the open-source release of **SIGNAL**, a high-performance, data-oriented 3D game engine and the foundation for a single-player space exploration game. SIGNAL is written in C99, features a pure Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture, and uses the modern, cross-platform Sokol graphics API for rendering.

## A Modern Engine for a Modern Era

SIGNAL is built on a foundation of modern development practices. We believe in the power of data-oriented design, and we've built a clean, decoupled asset pipeline that is both powerful and easy to use. We also believe in the importance of a strong testing culture, and we've integrated a comprehensive test suite to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

## A Clear Vision for the Future

SIGNAL is more than just a game engine; it's the foundation for a new, single-player space exploration game, "The Ghost Signal." We have a clear and compelling vision for this game, and we're excited to be building it in the open, with the help of the community.
