# CGame Engine Status Report & Recommendations

**Report Date:** June 29, 2025
**Author:** Gemini

## 1. Executive Summary

The CGame engine is a promising project with a solid architectural foundation based on the Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern. The recent migration to the Sokol graphics library has successfully unified the codebase under a single, modern, cross-platform API, which is a major achievement.

However, the project currently suffers from a significant amount of **stale documentation, an outdated build system, and a critical "last-mile" problem in the rendering pipeline.** While the core simulation and data systems are functional, there is no visual output, which severely hinders development and debugging.

This report provides a detailed analysis of the project's current state and offers a prioritized list of recommendations to address these issues. The immediate focus should be on restoring visual output, followed by a concerted effort to clean up documentation and the build process.

## 2. Current Status

### 2.1. Strengths

*   **Solid ECS Architecture:** The core of the engine (`core.c`, `systems.c`, `data.c`) is well-designed, adhering to data-oriented principles. The separation of concerns between data (components) and logic (systems) is clear.
*   **Successful Sokol Migration (Core):** The most difficult part of the migration is complete. The project has a single entry point and a stable event loop running on Sokol.
*   **Functional Asset Pipeline (CPU-side):** The Python-based asset pipeline in `tools/` is functional for processing mesh and material data into an intermediate format.
*   **Good Documentation Culture:** The extensive (though often outdated) documentation shows a commitment to clear project records, which is a major asset.

### 2.2. Weaknesses & Key Issues

*   **No Visual Output:** This is the most critical issue. As identified in `docs/sprints/04.1_sokol_rendering_refinement.md`, the link between the CPU-side asset data and the GPU-side `sokol_gfx` resources is missing.
*   **Outdated Documentation:** The `README.md`, `Makefile`, and many documents in the `docs/` folder are out of sync with the current state of the project. They reference obsolete technologies (SDL, Dear ImGui), contain incorrect build instructions, and point to non-existent files.
*   **Brittle Build System:** The `Makefile` is manually curated and has several issues:
    *   It contains rules for files that no longer exist (e.g., `render_3d.o`).
    *   The `SOURCES` list is incomplete, making the build process fragile.
    *   The Objective-C compilation rule for `main.c` is a workaround that should be properly integrated.
*   **Hardcoded Paths:** As noted in the tech debt report, hardcoded absolute paths in `src/systems.c` make the project non-portable.
*   **Incomplete UI:** The Nuklear-based UI is functional but requires significant work to become a useful debug tool.

## 3. Recommendations

The following recommendations are prioritized to address the most critical issues first and provide a clear path forward.

### ⭐️ Priority 1: Restore Visuals & Unblock Development

**Goal:** Get 3D graphics rendering on screen.

1.  **Execute Sprint 4.1:** The `docs/sprints/04.1_sokol_rendering_refinement.md` sprint plan is excellent and should be the immediate focus. This involves:
    *   Creating `sokol_gfx` resources (`sg_buffer`, `sg_image`) from the loaded asset data.
    *   Implementing a basic rendering system that draws entities with `Transform` and `Renderable` components.
    *   Passing camera matrices to the shaders.

### ⭐️ Priority 2: Project Hygiene & Developer Experience

**Goal:** Make the project easy to build, run, and understand for any developer.

1.  **Update the Makefile:**
    *   **Action:** Automate the source file discovery process instead of maintaining a manual `SOURCES` list.
    *   **Action:** Remove rules for obsolete files.
    *   **Action:** Clean up and document the platform-specific compilation flags.
2.  **Update the README.md:**
    *   **Action:** Remove all references to SDL.
    *   **Action:** Provide simple, correct build-and-run instructions (`make && ./build/cgame`).
    *   **Action:** Update the "Documentation Hub" to remove links to obsolete documents and add links to the new, relevant ones (like the Nuklear engineering report).
3.  **Fix Hardcoded Paths:**
    *   **Action:** Refactor the path initialization in `src/systems.c`. Use relative paths based on the executable's location, or implement a simple configuration file.

### ⭐️ Priority 3: Documentation Cleanup

**Goal:** Ensure all documentation is accurate, relevant, and easy to navigate.

1.  **Audit and Archive:**
    *   **Action:** Review every document in the `docs/` directory.
    *   **Action:** Move any document that is completely obsolete (e.g., the original Dear ImGui plans) to the `docs/sprints/archives/` directory.
    *   **Action:** For documents that are partially outdated, add a note at the top indicating their status and linking to the most current information.
2.  **Create a Central "State of the Engine" Document:**
    *   **Action:** Create a new document, `docs/project/CURRENT_STATUS.md`, that provides a high-level overview of the engine's current architecture, technology stack (confirming Nuklear), and development status. This will serve as the new entry point for anyone trying to understand the project.

### ⭐️ Priority 4: Feature Completion

**Goal:** Move forward with planned features now that the foundation is stable.

1.  **Complete UI Implementation:**
    *   **Action:** Execute the revised sprint plan for the Nuklear UI, focusing on creating a robust debug panel.
2.  **Implement PBR Shaders:**
    *   **Action:** Begin work on the PBR shader implementation as outlined in the original Sprint 4 goals, now that the rendering pipeline is unblocked.

By following these recommendations, the CGame project can quickly move from its current stalled state to a stable, productive, and enjoyable development experience.
