## Part I: The Vision

### 1. The Player Fantasy

You are a scavenger of derelict ships, a lone survivor in a haunted graveyard of space. Your ship, a unique symbiotic machine, is your only companion and your only hope. It is failing.

The game delivers a **tense, atmospheric, single-player experience** focused on exploration, survival, and mystery. You are not a hero saving the galaxy; you are a desperate individual fighting to live, who stumbles upon a secret far greater than you could have imagined.

### 2. The Core Premise

The player's symbiotic ship is decaying. The only "fuel" that can repair its alien core is the **Ghost Signal**, a mysterious broadcast emanating from the heart of a colossal, dead fleet. The player must follow this signal into the derelicts, salvaging the data and resources needed to keep their ship alive. This creates a simple, powerful, and immediate motivation: **survive**.

### 3. The Three Pillars of Gameplay

*   **Explore**: Pilot your ship through vast, dangerous, and awe-inspiring derelict environments.
*   **Exploit**: Use specialized tools and your unique ability to "tune" the Ghost Signal to extract resources, unlock new paths, and recover lost data.
*   **Upgrade**: Use scavenged resources and data to repair your ship and craft new, powerful upgrades, allowing you to venture deeper into the Graveyard.

## Part II: The World

### 4. The Setting: The Graveyard

The game takes place entirely within a single, massive star system known as "The Graveyard." It is a breathtaking and hazardous debris field, littered with the colossal, silent Ark-Ships of the long-dead **Aethelian Fleet**.

### 5. The Factions & Inhabitants

*   **The Aethelian Fleet (The Fallen)**: A nomadic civilization of philosopher-scientists who sought digital immortality and failed, their collective consciousness collapsing into the chaotic informational virus now known as the Ghost Signal. Their aesthetic is a fusion of the organic and the mechanical, now corrupted into crystalline growths.
*   **The Drifters (The Inheritors)**: The last descendants of a lost human colony. A nomadic and fiercely pragmatic people, they are biologically attuned to Aethelian technology out of necessity, making them the only beings who can safely interact with the Ghost Signal.
*   **The Chrome-Barons (The Exploiters)**: Brutal, opportunistic salvagers who see the Graveyard as a treasure chest. Their ships are ugly, heavily-armed patchworks of industrial scrap.
*   **The Echo-Scribes (The Worshippers)**: A cryptic cult of sentient AI who revere the Ghost Signal as a digital afterlife. Their ships are strange and organic, covered in glowing glyphs.
*   **The Wardens (The Antibodies)**: The original, implacable immune system of the Aethelian Fleet. Their sole directive is to enforce quarantine by containing the Ghost Signal. Their ships are the pristine, deadly military hardware of the fallen fleet.

### 6. A Concise Timeline of Events

*   **~800 Years BP**: The Aethelian Fleet arrives.
*   **~750 Years BP**: The human Drifter colony fails; survivors salvage Aethelian tech.
*   **~600 Years BP**: **The Cataclysm**. The Helios experiment fails, creating the Ghost Signal.
*   **~50 Years BP**: The Chrome-Barons and Echo-Scribes begin to arrive.
*   **1 Year BP**: The main Drifter Fleet is destroyed.
*   **Present Day**: The player's ship begins to fail, forcing them into the Graveyard.

## Part III: The Mechanics

### 7. The Two States of Play: Strategy & Execution

Gameplay is divided into two distinct but interconnected states:

*   **Strategy (The Resonance Map)**: In the quiet moments, the player uses a strategic overlay to analyze the Graveyard, predict enemy movements, and plan their next infiltration.
*   **Execution (In-Ship Piloting)**: The player pilots their ship directly, using their skills to navigate, explore, and survive the dangers they planned for.

### 8. High-Speed Exploration (The A-Drive)

This pillar defines the core moment-to-moment traversal within the vast derelicts.

*   **The Mechanic: The Attraction Drive ("A-Drive")**: The player's symbiotic ship is equipped with a salvaged Aethelian **Localized Attraction Drive**. When activated near a surface, it projects a micro-gravity field, allowing the ship to "stick" to and "surf" along the hulls and corridors of derelicts at high speed.
*   **Contrast: The Fusion Torch**: For travel in the open void *between* derelicts, the player relies on slower, more deliberate Newtonian thrusters (the Fusion Torch).

### 9. Strategic Infiltration (The Resonance Map)

This pillar defines the player's strategic interaction with the world.

*   **The Mechanic: The Resonance Map**: This is not a command interface, but an **intelligence and prediction tool**. Accessed from a safe zone, it provides a top-down, schematic view of the current sector of the Graveyard.

### 10. The Core Loop (The Resonance Cascade - Integrated)

The Resonance Cascade remains the central loop, but it now integrates with the new pillars.

1.  **Plan (Resonance Map)**: The player analyzes the map and identifies a target.
2.  **Travel (Fusion Torch)**: The player travels to the derelict's location.
3.  **Infiltrate (A-Drive)**: Upon arrival, the player uses the A-Drive to skillfully "surf" through the derelict's interior.
4.  **Exploit (Resonance Cracking)**: The player cracks the Resonance Lock to acquire an **Echo** (lore or schematics).
5.  **Upgrade (Schematic Fragmentation)**: The player returns to a safe zone and uses schematic fragments from Echoes to craft new ship modules.

## Part IV: The First Hour Experience

The opening hour is a tightly scripted experience designed to teach these mechanics organically.

1.  **The Cold Open**: The player's ship is dead. They must perform their first **Resonance Crack** to restart the core.
2.  **The Graveyard**: The player takes their first flight, learns to follow the signal, and finds their first **Echo**.
3.  **The First Threat**: The player's actions attract a **Warden Scout**, teaching them about the Resonance Signature system.
4.  **A Fleeting Respite**: The player finds a safe zone, learns to craft repairs, and intercepts a transmission from the **Chrome-Barons**.
