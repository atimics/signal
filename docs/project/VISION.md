# Project Vision: A Living, Breathing Universe

This document outlines the long-term vision for the 3D vector graphics space game. It serves as a guide for future development, ensuring that all new features and architectural decisions align with the project's core goals.

## 1. Core Philosophy: Emergent Narrative

The central goal is to create a **living, breathing universe** that is not driven by a predefined story, but by the interactions of its inhabitants. The player is not the center of the universe, but a participant in a larger simulation. The narrative should emerge organically from the actions of the player and the AI-driven entities.

## 2. Architectural Pillars

To achieve this vision, the architecture will be built on the following pillars:

*   **A Scalable, Data-Oriented Design:** The engine will be designed to support thousands of entities, each with its own state and behavior. This will be achieved through a data-oriented design that prioritizes cache-friendly data structures and efficient iteration.
*   **A Powerful and Flexible AI System:** The AI system is the heart of the living universe. It will be designed to be highly flexible, allowing for a wide range of behaviors and personalities. The AI will be able to learn, adapt, and react to the player's actions in a believable way.
*   **A Rich and Dynamic World:** The universe will be a dynamic place, with a variety of celestial bodies, factions, and points of interest. The world will be procedurally generated to ensure a unique experience for every player.
*   **A Robust and Extensible Modding API:** The engine will be designed to be easily extensible, with a robust modding API that allows the community to create new content, from ships and weapons to entire new storylines.

## 3. Key Features

The following key features will be implemented to support the project's vision:

*   **Dynamic Faction System:** The universe will be populated by a variety of factions, each with its own goals, territories, and relationships with other factions. The player's actions will have a direct impact on the balance of power in the universe.
*   **Procedural Quest Generation:** Quests will be procedurally generated based on the state of the universe. This will ensure that there is always something new and interesting to do, and that the player's actions have a meaningful impact on the world.
*   **Economic Simulation:** The universe will have a functioning economy, with resources being produced, traded, and consumed. The player can participate in the economy as a trader, a miner, or a pirate.
*   **Player-Driven Narrative:** The player's actions will have a direct impact on the narrative. There will be no "main quest," but rather a series of emergent storylines that are created by the player's interactions with the world.

## 4. Technology Stack

*   **Language:** C
*   **Graphics:** SDL2
*   **AI:** Custom engine with llama.cpp integration
*   **Build System:** Make
