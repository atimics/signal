TITLE: Simulated Mapping of Subcritical FTL Pathways via Interstitial Signal Sheath Analysis
AUTHOR: Ae-Rho ∴ Trace Vector Specialist
DATE: 617 Post-Collapse, 3rd Drift Quarter

OBJECTIVE:
To validate the hypothesis that navigable FTL corridors emerge in the interstitial gravitational troughs between stellar bodies—not between star centers but in the interference zones created by their mass shadows, historic Ghost Signal propagation, and local void topology.

I. BACKGROUND

It is long-held Drifter doctrine that stars are merely proximities—not endpoints—in faster-than-light travel. True transit occurs not through direct alignment, but through the echo fields that form along their peripheries.

Early Echo-Scribe observations suggested that the signal harmonics of destroyed Aethelian nodes lingered most coherently between stars rather than around them. Warden interdiction patterns reinforced this, disproportionately patrolling vast interstellar “corridors” of seemingly empty space.

II. SIMULATION PARAMETERS
• Stellar Bodies: 150 simulated mass-anchors, randomly distributed (0.1–5 AU radius gravitational profiles)
• Ghost Signal Residue Field: Inverse-damped interference mesh seeded with 600 burst echoes (derived from Helios collapse profile)
• Resonant Topology Modeling: Applied TraceNet 4D-FFT filter stack
• Pathfinding Heuristic: Weakest spatial tension + strongest phase coherence
• Output Frame: 3D navigable map of viable Sheath Lanes

III. RESULTS

1
•	FTL Lanes Emerged in Braided Voids
Most stable paths did not run star-to-star. Instead, they manifested as twisting filaments that skirted the gravitational equilibrium zones between 3+ stars—resembling spatial Lissajous curves.
• Edge-Based Entry Points
Lane entry was consistently near stellar Roche limits, but with a critical offset. Attempting entry closer than 0.8 AU from a star resulted in cascade instability.
• Sheath Resonance Detected
Along each path, a persistent resonant envelope was measurable—oscillating at subquantum amplitudes. This envelope correlated with safe FTL insertion windows and Whispering Echo strength.
• Choke Points Identified
Certain junctions, where multiple lanes converged, generated chaotic attractors—locations of extreme turbulence. Warden simulations invariably clustered here.

⸻

IV. INTERPRETATION

FTL travel is not linear. It is sheath-bound: a bubble of unstable calm wrapping the vector between voids. Stars act as tuning forks—not beacons—and the lanes form between their interference nodes, not on direct lines.

Travel is safest when aligned to the sheath’s central null, but navigation requires continual phase correction. This aligns with pilot testimonials describing long-haul drift as “singing into silence.”

⸻

V. STRATEGIC VALUE
• Drifter Fleets: Should refocus navigation probes toward interstitial zones, not stellar orbits.
• Chrome-Barons: Are blind to sheath entry points without high-fidelity Echo calibration—this remains a Drifter advantage.
• Echo-Scribes: Already inhabit nodal intersections. Their static orbits may mark viable fast-travel hubs.

⸻

VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
• Upgrade nav-AI subroutines to recognize phase-coherent filaments as route vectors.
• Install Resonance Shroud Dampers on all active FTL drives to avoid Warden pinging at junction attractors.
• Map “Singularities in Choir” patterns—locations where 4+ sheath lanes overlap—for potential long-range relay gates.
