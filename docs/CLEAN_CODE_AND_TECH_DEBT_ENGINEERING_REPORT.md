# Clean Code and Technical Debt Engineering Report

**Report Date:** June 29, 2025
**Author:** System Analysis

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides an analysis of the CGame engine's codebase, focusing on adherence to clean code principles and the identification of technical debt. The project is built on a strong, well-documented Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture. However, the ongoing migration from SDL to the Sokol graphics API has introduced significant technical debt that, if left unaddressed, will impede future development and stability.

The most critical issue is the presence of a **dual-entry-point system** (`main.c` for Sokol and `test.c` for SDL), which creates ambiguity and risk. Other major sources of technical debt include dead code, incomplete feature implementations, hardcoded paths, and the use of global state.

This report recommends a series of immediate and medium-term actions to address these issues, with the primary goal of consolidating the codebase into a single, coherent, and maintainable Sokol-based application.

## 2. Codebase Analysis

### 2.1. Adherence to Architectural Principles

The core of the engine, primarily in `core.c` and `systems.c`, adheres well to the documented ECS architecture. The separation of data (components) and logic (systems) is clear and consistent. The data-oriented design principles, such as storing components in contiguous arrays, are also well-implemented.

### 2.2. Key Areas of Technical Debt

#### 2.2.1. Dead and Redundant Code

*   **Issue:** The `src` directory contains several old and backup files:
    *   `main_old.c`
    *   `render_3d_old.c`
    *   `render_3d_backup_old.c`
*   **Impact:** These files create clutter, increase the cognitive load on developers, and can lead to confusion about which code is currently in use.
*   **Severity:** High

#### 2.2.2. Dual Entry Points and Conflicting Implementations

*   **Issue:** The project has two main entry points: `main` in `test.c` (using SDL) and `sokol_main` in `main.c` (using Sokol). This has resulted in a confusing and error-prone state where it is unclear which entry point is authoritative.
*   **Impact:** This is the most significant source of technical debt. It makes the project difficult to build, run, and debug. It also makes it impossible to reason about the application's behavior without understanding the complex interplay between the two entry points.
*   **Severity:** Critical

#### 2.2.3. Incomplete Feature Implementations

*   **Issue:** Several key features have been disabled during the Sokol migration, including:
    *   Mesh rendering (`render_mesh.c`)
    *   UI (`ui.c`)
*   **Impact:** This leaves the application in a partially functional state. While this is expected during a migration, it becomes technical debt if not addressed promptly.
*   **Severity:** High

#### 2.2.4. Hardcoded Paths and Lack of Portability

*   **Issue:** The asset and data paths are hardcoded in `systems.c`:
    ```c
    assets_init(&g_asset_registry, "/Users/ratimics/develop/cgame/build/assets");
    data_registry_init(&g_data_registry, "/Users/ratimics/develop/cgame/data");
    ```
*   **Impact:** This makes the project non-portable and difficult for other developers to set up.
*   **Severity:** Medium

#### 2.2.5. Use of Global State

*   **Issue:** `systems.c` uses global variables for the asset registry, data registry, and render configuration.
*   **Impact:** This creates tight coupling between systems and makes the code harder to test and maintain. It also introduces the risk of unintended side effects.
*   **Severity:** Medium

#### 2.2.6. Lack of Robust Error Handling

*   **Issue:** The code often lacks robust error handling, particularly in file I/O and asset loading. For example, `fopen` calls are not always checked for `NULL` return values.
*   **Impact:** This can lead to unexpected crashes and make the application difficult to debug.
*   **Severity:** Medium

## 3. Recommendations

### 3.1. Immediate Actions (Next 1-2 Sprints)

1.  **Consolidate Entry Points:**
    *   Merge all essential logic from `test.c` into `main.c`.
    *   Remove the `main` function from `test.c` and make `sokol_main` the sole entry point.
    *   Delete `test.c`.

2.  **Remove Dead Code:**
    *   Delete the following files:
        *   `src/main_old.c`
        *   `src/render_3d_old.c`
        *   `src/render_3d_backup_old.c`

3.  **Re-enable Core Features:**
    *   Re-implement `render_mesh.c` and `ui.c` using Sokol-native rendering.

### 3.2. Medium-Term Actions (Next 3-4 Sprints)

1.  **Refactor Global State:**
    *   Pass the asset registry, data registry, and render configuration as parameters to the systems that need them, rather than relying on global variables.

2.  **Improve Portability:**
    *   Use relative paths or a configuration file to specify asset and data directories.

3.  **Improve Error Handling:**
    *   Add robust error handling to all file I/O and asset loading operations.

## 4. Conclusion

The CGame engine has a solid architectural foundation. However, the ongoing Sokol migration has introduced significant technical debt that must be addressed to ensure the project's long-term health and maintainability. By following the recommendations in this report, the development team can eliminate the most critical sources of technical debt and create a clean, stable, and portable codebase.
