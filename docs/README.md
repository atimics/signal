# CGame Documentation

Welcome to the CGame engine documentation. This is the central hub for all project-related documentation.

## Getting Started

If you are new to the project, please start with the [Getting Started Guide](./guides/GETTING_STARTED.md). This will walk you through the process of setting up your development environment and running the engine for the first time.

## Developer Guides

*   **[Development Workflow](./guides/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md)**: A detailed guide covering the day-to-day development process, including the build system, asset pipeline, and coding standards.
*   **[Architecture](./guides/ARCHITECTURE.md)**: A high-level overview of the engine's design, including the ECS, rendering pipeline, and other core systems.

## Archive

All other documents, including old sprint plans, outdated guides, and historical engineering reports, are located in the [archive](./archive/) directory.
