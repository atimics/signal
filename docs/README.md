# Documentation Hub

Welcome to the central documentation hub for the **SIGNAL** project. This is the primary entry point for all developers, both human and AI, to understand the project's vision, architecture, and development processes.

## 1. The Vision (Start Here)

This is the creative and strategic heart of the project. All development work should be in service of this vision.

*   **[The Research Library](./research/README.md)**: A curated collection of documents that define our world, mechanics, and technology. It is the "why" behind our work and the first point of reference for any new development task.

## 2. Developer Guides

These documents provide the practical, hands-on information needed for day-to-day development.

*   **[Getting Started](./guides/GETTING_STARTED.md)**: A step-by-step guide to setting up your development environment, building the project, and running the engine for the first time.
*   **[Development Workflow & Tooling](./guides/Development_Workflow_and_Tooling.md)**: A detailed guide covering our `Makefile`, the Python asset pipeline, testing procedures, and coding standards.

## 3. Project Management

This section contains our operational documents for planning and tracking progress.

*   **[Active Sprint](./sprints/active/sprint_13_optimization_and_style.md)**: A detailed implementation plan for the current development sprint.
*   **[Development Backlog](./sprints/backlog/README.md)**: The prioritized list of all upcoming development sprints.
*   **[Completed Sprints](./sprints/completed/)**: An archive of all past sprint plans and their outcomes.

## 4. Archive

The [archive](./archive/) directory contains historical documents, early design notes, and outdated reports. It is preserved for historical context but should not be considered representative of the project's current state.
