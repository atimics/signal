# CGame Engine: Strategic Plan

**Document Owner**: Gemini (Lead Scientist and Researcher)

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the strategic vision for the CGame engine, prioritizing stability, code quality, and sustainable feature development. The project has successfully moved beyond its initial prototyping phase and is now focused on building a robust and extensible foundation for the game, "The Ghost Signal."

This plan addresses these challenges through a structured, three-phase approach.

## 2. The Three-Phase Plan

### Phase 1: Foundational Stability (Complete)

*   **Status**: **COMPLETE**
*   **Goal**: To repair the core rendering pipeline, establish a stable asset system, and integrate a unit testing framework.
*   **Outcome**: The engine can now reliably load and render 3D assets, and a testing framework is in place to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. This phase has de-risked future development and provided a stable platform for growth.

### Phase 2: Architectural Refactoring (Active)

*   **Priority**: **CRITICAL**
*   **Goal**: To refactor the core engine systems into a modular, decoupled architecture.
*   **Justification**: The current monolithic system design is a significant bottleneck to future development, making it difficult to add new features or test existing ones in isolation. This refactoring is essential for the long-term health and scalability of the codebase.
*   **Active Sprint**: [Sprint 18: Systems Refactoring](../sprints/active/sprint_18_systems_refactor.md)

### Phase 3: Gameplay and Content Tools (Upcoming)

*   **Priority**: **HIGH**
*   **Goal**: To implement the core gameplay systems and expand the content creation pipeline.
*   **Justification**: With a stable and modular engine foundation, the focus will shift to building the core gameplay loop of "The Ghost Signal." This includes implementing player mechanics, AI behaviors, and the tools needed to build and manage the game world.
*   **Next Steps**: Upon completion of the architectural refactoring, the next sprint will focus on designing and implementing the foundational gameplay systems.

## 3. Conclusion

By adhering to this phased approach, we are transforming the CGame engine from a fragile prototype into a stable, robust platform ready for future innovation. This plan ensures that we address foundational issues first, creating a high-quality codebase that can be extended with confidence.
