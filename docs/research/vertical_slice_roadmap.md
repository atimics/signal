## A. Scope Prioritization: What’s Essential vs. Aspirational

### 1. Absolute Core—“The Minimum Viable Ghost Signal”

*   **Atmospheric, single-player haunted exploration**
*   **Integrated Gameplay Loop:**
    *   **A-Drive Flight Model**: Functional, physics-based "proximity surfing" for in-wreck traversal.
    *   **Resonance Map (Basic)**: A 2D map showing player location, derelict outlines, and at least one static Warden patrol route to teach avoidance.
    *   **Resonance Cracking Minigame**: Core lockpicking/puzzle.
    *   **Echoes as Keys**: At least 2 types (e.g., Engineering, Security).
    *   **Resonance Signature**: Risk/reward system driving Warden response.
*   **Progression via Schematic Fragmentation**: Finding fragments for at least one engine and one ship system upgrade.
*   **Environmental Storytelling**: One major derelict, 5-10 Whispering Echoes.
*   **Opening Hour Experience**: As scripted, teaching all core systems organically.
