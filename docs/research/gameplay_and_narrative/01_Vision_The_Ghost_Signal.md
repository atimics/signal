## 1. The Player Fantasy

**You are a scavenger of derelict ships, a lone survivor in a haunted graveyard of space. Your ship, a unique symbiotic machine, is your only companion and your only hope. It is failing.**

The game delivers a **tense, atmospheric, single-player experience** focused on exploration, survival, and mystery. The player is not a hero on a quest to save the galaxy; they are a desperate individual fighting for their own survival, who, in the process, stumbles upon a secret far greater than they could have imagined.

## 2. The Core Premise

The player's symbiotic ship is decaying. The only "fuel" that can repair its alien core is the **Ghost Signal**, a mysterious broadcast emanating from the heart of a colossal, dead fleet. The player must follow this signal into the derelicts, salvaging the data and resources needed to keep their ship alive.

This creates a simple, powerful, and immediate motivation: **survive**. The mystery of the fleet and the signal is secondary to the player's primary need to find the next "fix" to keep their engine from collapsing.

## 3. The Three Pillars of Gameplay

Everything the player does is built upon three core, interconnected pillars:

*   **Explore**: The player pilots their ship through vast, dangerous, and awe-inspiring derelict environments. Skillful piloting and situational awareness are paramount.
*   **Exploit**: The player uses specialized tools and their unique ability to "tune" the Ghost Signal to extract resources, unlock new paths, and recover lost data (Echoes).
*   **Upgrade**: The player uses the scavenged resources and data to repair their ship and craft new, powerful upgrades. This progression loop allows them to venture deeper into more hazardous, more rewarding areas of the Graveyard.

## 4. The Narrative Unveiling

The story is not told; it is discovered. By collecting Echoes, the player pieces together the tragic history of the Aethelian Fleet and the nature of the Cataclysm that destroyed them. The narrative is designed to unfold in three distinct acts:

*   **Act I: Survival**: The player's focus is on their own survival. The Ghost Signal is a resource, nothing more.
*   **Act II: Mystery**: The player begins to understand that the Echoes contain more than just schematics. They are the fragmented memories of a lost civilization. The "what happened here?" becomes a compelling driver.
*   **Act III: Revelation**: The player reaches the source of the signal and uncovers the full truth. They are faced with a choice that will determine the fate of the Ghost Signal and the future of the Graveyard itself.

## 5. Guiding Principles

This vision is our North Star. It is grounded in our existing technology and provides a clear, achievable path for development. All new features, from rendering technology to AI behavior, should be measured against this core vision: does it enhance the fantasy of being a lone survivor in a haunted, mysterious universe?
