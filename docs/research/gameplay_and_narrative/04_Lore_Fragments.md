### Category: Personal Audio Logs

**Fragment ID**: PAL-042-A
**Source**: Dr. Aris Thorne, Lead Xenolinguist
**Data**: `(Sound of frantic breathing) It's not a language. Not in any sense we understand. It's... a resonance. A frequency that matches the quantum state of water molecules. It's singing to the water in our cells, and I fear the song is a dirge. We shouldn't have answered.`

**Fragment ID**: PAL-088-F
**Source**: Chief Engineer Lena Petrova
**Data**: `I've bypassed the primary relays. The engine should hold... for now. But the metal... the very hull of this ship... it's starting to resonate. It's... changing. Growing. I saw... I swear I saw circuits forming in the bulkhead like frost on a window. This isn't a machine anymore.`

**Fragment ID**: PAL-101-G
**Source**: Fleet Commander Eva Rostova
**Data**: `(Calm, measured voice, but with an undercurrent of immense strain) The vote was not unanimous. But it was decisive. The quarantine protocol is our last, only option. We are the wall. We are the firebreak. The Ghost Signal dies with us. May future generations, if any, forgive us. Rostova out.`

**Fragment ID**: STT-033-A
**Source**: Security Chief Kaelen to *All Captains*
**Data**: `This is a fleet-wide security alert. We have multiple reports of... crystalline growths... on interior bulkheads. They appear to be resonating with the signal. Do not touch them. I repeat, quarantine any affected decks immediately. Kaelen out.`

**Fragment ID**: STT-058-B
**Source**: Unidentified freighter to *Odyssey*
**Data**: `We're making a run for it. The Commander's quarantine is a death sentence. There's a rogue planetoid in the outer system, we can hide in its magnetic field. Anyone who wants to live, join us at... [STATIC, followed by the sound of a weapon charging and a sudden cut]`

### Category: Engineering Logs (Recovered Data)

**Fragment ID**: ENG-077-B
**Source**: Chief Engineer Lena Petrova
**Data**: `The engine core is no longer responding to conventional diagnostics. It's... reconfiguring itself. The energy output is triple what it should be, but it's not heat, it's... something else. It's warping the space around the drive cones. I don't think this ship is flying on thrusters anymore.`

**Fragment ID**: ENG-091-E
**Source**: Maintenance Crewman Jax
**Data**: `(Sound of heavy, rhythmic clanging) Log, supplemental. The... growths... they're not just on the walls. They're in the nutrient paste dispensers. In the water recyclers. We ran a spectral analysis. It's silicon, but it's... it's rearranging itself into a protein-like structure. It's mimicking us.`
