# Core Gameplay Mechanics (Revised)

**ID**: `R22_Resonance_and_Narrative_v2`
**Status**: **PROPOSED CANONICAL**

## 1. Overview

This document details the core, moment-to-moment gameplay systems of "The Ghost Signal." It translates the high-level vision into a concrete set of interconnected mechanics. The guiding principle is that **narrative is a tool for gameplay, and gameplay is the engine of narrative discovery.** This version integrates the **Attraction Drive** for high-speed exploration and the **Resonance Map** for strategic planning.

## 2. The Two States of Play: Strategy & Execution

Gameplay is now divided into two distinct but interconnected states:

*   **Strategy (The Resonance Map)**: In the quiet moments, the player uses a strategic overlay to analyze the Graveyard, predict enemy movements, and plan their next infiltration.
*   **Execution (In-Ship Piloting)**: The player pilots their ship directly, using their skills to navigate, explore, and survive the dangers they planned for.

## 3. Pillar I: High-Speed Exploration (The A-Drive)

This pillar defines the core moment-to-moment traversal within the vast derelicts.

*   **The Mechanic: The Attraction Drive ("A-Drive")**: The player's symbiotic ship is equipped with a salvaged Aethelian **Localized Attraction Drive**. When activated near a surface, it projects a micro-gravity field, allowing the ship to "stick" to and "surf" along the hulls and corridors of derelicts at high speed.
    *   **Gameplay**: This is a high-skill, physics-based system. Players can perform long, graceful drifts around corners, chain together boosts, and navigate complex wreckage with thrilling speed and agility.
    *   **Cost & Risk**: The A-Drive consumes significant energy, making it a resource to be managed. High-speed surfing also increases the risk of collision and makes the player's Resonance Signature more detectable to nearby hostiles.
*   **Contrast: The Fusion Torch**: For travel in the open void *between* derelicts, the player relies on slower, more deliberate Newtonian thrusters (the Fusion Torch). This creates a clear distinction between the strategic, long-haul travel of open space and the high-octane, tactical "canyon running" inside the wrecks.

## 4. Pillar II: Strategic Infiltration (The Resonance Map)

This pillar defines the player's strategic interaction with the world. It is the "abstract game layer."

*   **The Mechanic: The Resonance Map**: This is not a command interface, but an **intelligence and prediction tool**. Accessed from a safe zone, it provides a top-down, schematic view of the current sector of the Graveyard.
    *   **Information Display**: The map visualizes data intercepted from the Ghost Signal:
        *   Known **Warden** patrol routes and escalation levels.
        *   Predicted **Chrome-Baron** salvage operations and attack vectors.
        *   Locations of **Echo-Scribe** data-shrines and their passive observation zones.
        *   Areas of high resonance, potential Echo sources, and environmental hazards.
    *   **Player Agency**: The player cannot command factions, but they can *influence* and *exploit* them.
        *   **Planning**: Set waypoints and plot courses to avoid patrols or intercept targets of opportunity.
        *   **Prediction**: See the likely outcome of faction clashes (e.g., "Chrome-Barons will be weakened after attacking that Warden outpost").
        *   **Manipulation (Unlockable)**: Later upgrades, discovered via Echoes, might allow the player to trigger events, such as creating a "ghost" resonance signal to lure a Warden patrol away from their intended target.

## 5. Pillar III: The Core Loop (The Resonance Cascade - Integrated)

The Resonance Cascade remains the central loop, but it now integrates with the new pillars.

1.  **Plan (Resonance Map)**: The player analyzes the map and identifies a target—a derelict with a promising `Engineering` Echo, currently unguarded.
2.  **Travel (Fusion Torch)**: The player travels to the derelict's location using their slow, efficient thrusters.
3.  **Infiltrate (A-Drive)**: Upon arrival, the player uses the A-Drive to skillfully "surf" through the derelict's interior, avoiding hazards and reaching the target location quickly.
4.  **Exploit (Resonance Cracking)**: The player cracks the Resonance Lock to acquire the `Engineering` Echo.
5.  **Upgrade (Schematic Fragmentation)**: The player returns to a safe zone. The new Echo provides a schematic fragment that, when combined with others, unlocks a new ship module—perhaps an upgrade that reveals more detailed information on the **Resonance Map**, creating a powerful, self-reinforcing loop.
