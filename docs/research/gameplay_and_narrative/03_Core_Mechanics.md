## 1. Overview

This document details the core, moment-to-moment gameplay systems of "The Ghost Signal." It translates the high-level vision into a concrete set of interconnected mechanics that are designed to be deep, rewarding, and intuitive. The guiding principle is that **narrative is a tool for gameplay, and gameplay is the engine of narrative discovery.**

## 2. The Resonance Cascade: The Core Loop

The **Resonance Cascade** is the unified system that links exploration, narrative, and progression. It is composed of three parts:

### 2.1. Resonance Cracking (The Action)

This is the player's primary interaction with the world beyond basic flight.

*   **The Mechanic**: The player uses their ship's **Resonance Attenuator** to "crack" **Resonance Locks** found on derelicts. This initiates a skill-based minigame where the player must modulate their beam's frequency to match a target waveform.
*   **The Purpose**: Successfully cracking a lock is the only way to acquire **Echoes** (lore and schematics).

### 2.2. Echoes as Keys (The Strategy)

Every piece of lore is a tool.

*   **The Mechanic**: The player can slot a limited number of recovered Echoes into their ship's **Attunement Matrix**. Each Echo has a **Resonance Type** (e.g., `Engineering`, `Security`, `Medical`).
*   **The Purpose**: The types of Echoes the player has attuned determine which types of Resonance Locks are visible and interactable in the world. Slotting an `Engineering` Echo reveals all nearby `Engineering` locks. This makes exploration a strategic choice, not a random search.

### 2.3. The Resonance Signature (The Risk)

This system adds a layer of risk vs. reward to the player's choices.

*   **The Mechanic**: The player's ship has a **Resonance Signature** level, visible on the HUD. This level increases based on the number and power of the Echoes currently slotted in the Attunement Matrix.
*   **The Purpose**: A higher signature makes the player "louder" in the void.
    *   **High Signature**: Allows the player to detect and crack rare, high-level Resonance Locks, but also attracts the attention of powerful Wardens and Chrome-Baron crews.
    *   **Low Signature**: Allows the player to move stealthily and avoid combat, but limits them to common, low-reward Resonance Locks.

## 3. Schematic Fragmentation (The Progression)

Upgrades are not found; they are reconstructed.

*   **The Mechanic**: The player collects **Schematic Fragments** from specific Echoes. At a **Workbench** in their safehouse, they can slot these fragments into schematics for new ship modules.
*   **The Purpose**: This creates a powerful, non-linear progression system. A player who desperately needs a better engine will be highly motivated to seek out `Engineering` Echoes. This directly ties narrative discovery to tangible, gameplay-altering rewards.

## 4. Whispering Echoes (The Atmosphere)

The world is haunted by its past.

*   **The Mechanic**: As the player explores, they will trigger brief, non-collectible, audio-visual ghostly events.
*   **The Purpose**: These **Whispering Echoes** serve to deepen the atmosphere, provide subtle environmental storytelling, and can occasionally offer cryptic clues or warnings about the immediate surroundings, making the world feel alive and reactive.
