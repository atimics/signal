# Vision & Pitch: "SIGNAL"

**ID**: `R17_Gameplay_Vision`
**Author**: Gemini, Chief Science Officer
**Status**: **Active Pitch**

## 1. The Pitch (Mass-Market Appeal)

**In the silent graveyards of space, a ghost signal is calling. And you are the only one who can answer.**

You are a **Signal-Runner**, a scavenger of the void equipped with a unique gift: the power to tune into the final, dying transmissions of a long-lost alien race. Pilot your custom ship through the colossal wrecks of their fallen civilization, battling rogue AI and rival salvagers as you hunt for the ultimate prize: the truth behind the silence.

**SIGNAL** is a single-player, open-world space adventure that combines high-speed ship combat, deep exploration, and a mystery that unfolds with every piece of data you uncover.

## 2. Core Features (The "What You Do")

*   **BECOME A SIGNAL-RUNNER**: Use your unique power to **"Tune the Signal."** This core ability transforms the world around you, revealing hidden platforms, reactivating ancient machinery, and showing you ghostly visions of the past. But be warned: activating the signal can also trigger deadly automated defense systems.
*   **EXPLORE THE VOID**: Navigate treacherous debris fields and delve into the awe-inspiring interiors of derelict alien megastructures. Every wreck is a massive, hand-crafted dungeon filled with secrets to uncover and dangers to overcome.
*   **BUILD THE ULTIMATE SHIP**: Survive by scavenging for resources and technology. Use what you find to upgrade your ship's weapons, shields, and engines. Unlock new, powerful abilities by deciphering the alien signals you collect, allowing you to venture deeper into the most dangerous and rewarding ruins.
*   **UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY**: The story is a puzzle, and you hold the pieces. Collect fragmented audio logs, holographic recordings, and corrupted data streams. Bring them back to your base and piece together the chilling story of a civilization on the brink of collapse.
*   **SURVIVE A DYNAMIC UNIVERSE**: You are not alone. The void is filled with other AI-driven factions who want the alien technology for themselves. Outsmart the ruthless **Chrome-Barons**, negotiate with the cryptic **Echo-Scribes**, and evade the implacable **Wardens**, the ancient guardians of the wrecks. Your actions matter, and your reputation will precede you.

## 3. The Core Gameplay Loop (Simplified)

1.  **HUNT**: Detect a signal and fly your ship into a massive alien wreck.
2.  **TUNE**: Use your power to reveal hidden paths and secrets, but be ready for a fight.
3.  **LOOT**: Scavenge for valuable resources, powerful ship upgrades, and critical story fragments.
4.  **UPGRADE**: Return to your base to install new gear and piece together the story.
5.  **REPEAT**: Use your new power and knowledge to take on even bigger, more dangerous wrecks.

## 4. Connecting to Deeper Themes (Internal Guide)

While the pitch is action-oriented, it is built on our established philosophical roots:
*   **"Tuning the Signal"** is the mass-market term for the **Resonance** mechanic.
*   **"Story Fragments"** are the **Echoes**.
*   **"Upgrading from Signals"** is the **Harmony** progression system.
*   The core Deleuzian concept of the "rhizome"—a non-hierarchical, interconnected network of information—is perfectly embodied in the player-driven discovery of the story. The player creates their own "lines of flight" through the narrative space.
*   The AI factions represent different relationships to the "Body without Organs" that is the Chorus—some seek to exploit it (Barons), some to deify it (Scribes), and some to contain it (Wardens).

This dual-layer approach allows us to build a game with immediate, visceral appeal that is also deeply rewarding for players who choose to engage with its underlying thematic structure.
