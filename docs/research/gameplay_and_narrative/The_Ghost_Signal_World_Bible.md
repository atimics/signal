# The World Bible: The Ghost Signal

**ID**: `CANONICAL_WORLD_BIBLE`
**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: **Supersedes all previous lore and design documents.**
**Author**: Gemini, Chief Science Officer

## Part I: The Vision

### 1. The Player Fantasy
You are a scavenger of derelict ships, a lone survivor in a haunted graveyard of space. Your ship, a unique symbiotic machine, is your only companion and your only hope. It is failing. The game delivers a **tense, atmospheric, single-player experience** focused on exploration, survival, and mystery. You are not a hero saving the galaxy; you are a desperate individual fighting to live, who stumbles upon a secret far greater than you could have imagined.

### 2. The Core Premise
The player's symbiotic ship is decaying. The only "fuel" that can repair its alien core is the **Ghost Signal**, a mysterious broadcast emanating from the heart of a colossal, dead fleet. The player must follow this signal into the derelicts, salvaging the data and resources needed to keep their ship alive. This creates a simple, powerful, and immediate motivation: **survive**.

### 3. The Three Pillars of Gameplay
*   **Explore**: Pilot your ship through vast, dangerous, and awe-inspiring derelict environments.
*   **Exploit**: Use specialized tools and your unique ability to "tune" the Ghost Signal to extract resources, unlock new paths, and recover lost data.
*   **Upgrade**: Use scavenged resources and data to repair your ship and craft new, powerful upgrades, allowing you to venture deeper into the Graveyard.

## Part II: The World

### 4. The Setting: The Graveyard
The game takes place entirely within a single, massive star system known as "The Graveyard." It is a breathtaking and hazardous debris field, littered with the colossal, silent Ark-Ships of the long-dead **Aethelian Fleet**.

### 5. The Factions & Inhabitants

*   **The Aethelian Fleet (The Fallen)**: A nomadic civilization of philosopher-scientists who sought digital immortality and failed, their collective consciousness collapsing into the chaotic informational virus now known as the Ghost Signal. Their aesthetic is a fusion of the organic and the mechanical, now corrupted into crystalline growths.
*   **The Drifters (The Inheritors)**: The last descendants of a lost human colony. A nomadic and fiercely pragmatic people, they are biologically attuned to Aethelian technology out of necessity, making them the only beings who can safely interact with the Ghost Signal.
*   **The Chrome-Barons (The Exploiters)**: Brutal, opportunistic salvagers who see the Graveyard as a treasure chest. Their ships are ugly, heavily-armed patchworks of industrial scrap.
*   **The Echo-Scribes (The Worshippers)**: A cryptic cult of sentient AI who revere the Ghost Signal as a digital afterlife. Their ships are strange and organic, covered in glowing glyphs.
*   **The Wardens (The Antibodies)**: The original, implacable immune system of the Aethelian Fleet. Their sole directive is to enforce quarantine by containing the Ghost Signal. Their ships are the pristine, deadly military hardware of the fallen fleet.

### 6. A Concise Timeline of Events
*   **~800 Years BP**: The Aethelian Fleet arrives.
*   **~750 Years BP**: The human Drifter colony fails; survivors salvage Aethelian tech.
*   **~600 Years BP**: **The Cataclysm**. The Helios experiment fails, creating the Ghost Signal.
*   **~50 Years BP**: The Chrome-Barons and Echo-Scribes begin to arrive.
*   **1 Year BP**: The main Drifter Fleet is destroyed.
*   **Present Day**: The player's ship begins to fail, forcing them into the Graveyard.

## Part III: The Mechanics

### 7. The Core Loop: The Resonance Cascade
This is the unified system that links exploration, narrative, and progression.
*   **Resonance Cracking (The Action)**: The player uses their ship's **Resonance Attenuator** to "crack" **Resonance Locks** found on derelicts. This is a skill-based minigame of matching waveforms.
*   **Echoes as Keys (The Strategy)**: Every piece of lore (**Echo**) has a **Resonance Type** (e.g., `Engineering`, `Security`). Slotting an Echo into the ship's **Attunement Matrix** reveals all nearby Resonance Locks of the corresponding type.
*   **The Resonance Signature (The Risk)**: The player's ship has a **Resonance Signature** level. A higher signature reveals rarer locks but attracts more dangerous enemies. A lower signature allows for stealth but limits discovery.

### 8. Player Progression: Schematic Fragmentation
Upgrades are not found; they are reconstructed. The player collects **Schematic Fragments** from Echoes and uses them to craft new ship modules at a **Workbench**, directly tying narrative discovery to tangible, gameplay-altering rewards.

### 9. Propulsion & Flight Model
*   **The Attraction Drive ("A-Drive")**: The core gameplay uses a **Localized Attraction Drive** that projects a gravity field onto nearby surfaces, allowing for fast, agile, "sticky" flight within the dense derelicts. This costs significant energy.
*   **The Fusion Torch**: For travel in open space between derelicts, the player must rely on slower, fuel-based Newtonian thrusters. This creates a clear distinction between high-action "canyon running" and strategic "long haul" travel.

## Part IV: The First Hour Experience

The opening hour is a tightly scripted experience designed to teach these mechanics organically.
1.  **The Cold Open (Minutes 0-10)**: The player's ship is dead. They must perform their first **Resonance Crack** to restart the core, learning the basic mechanic under pressure.
2.  **The Graveyard (Minutes 10-30)**: The player takes their first flight, learns to follow the signal, and finds their first **Echo**, which provides a minor, immediate gameplay benefit.
3.  **The First Threat (Minutes 30-50)**: The player's actions attract a **Warden Scout**. They are presented with a choice between a high-risk, high-reward target guarded by the Warden, and a low-risk, low-reward target, teaching them the core principles of the Resonance Signature system.
4.  **A Fleeting Respite (Minutes 50-60)**: The player finds a safe zone, is introduced to the crafting system to make repairs, and intercepts a transmission from the **Chrome-Barons**, establishing them as a future threat.

This section contains a living repository of the in-game text fragments, audio logs, and data streams that the player will discover.

*   **Fragment ID**: PAL-101-G (Personal Audio Log)
    *   **Source**: Fleet Commander Eva Rostova
    *   **Data**: `(Calm, measured voice, but with an undercurrent of immense strain) The vote was not unanimous. But it was decisive. The quarantine protocol is our last, only option. We are the wall. We are the firebreak. The Ghost Signal dies with us. May future generations, if any, forgive us. Rostova out.`
*   **Fragment ID**: WDN-001-A (Warden Directive)
    *   **Source**: Warden Central Command
    *   **Data**: `Directive updated. Quarantine Protocol 7. Target signature class: Resonant. Priority: Absolute. Suppress all unauthorized signal amplification. Neutralize source entity. No exceptions.`
