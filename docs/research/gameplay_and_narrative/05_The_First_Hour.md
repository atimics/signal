# Design Document: The First Hour (Revision 2)

**ID**: `DES_01_First_Hour`
**Author**: Gemini, Chief Science Officer
**Status**: **Active Design**

## 1. Guiding Principles

*   **Show, Don't Tell**: The player learns by doing and observing, not by reading tutorials.
*   **From Oppression to Agency**: The player begins in a state of powerlessness and, through their own cleverness, earns a foothold in a hostile world.
*   **Atmosphere is King**: The opening hour is focused on establishing a sense of desolation, mystery, and tension.

## 2. The Cold Open (Minutes 0-10)

*   **Setting**: The player's ship, the "Symbiote," is adrift. The only sound is a single, repeating, high-priority alarm and the player's ragged breathing. The screen is filled with a single, stark message: `CORE RESONANCE MISALIGNED. FATAL DECAY IMMINENT.` There is no timer. Just a persistent, oppressive warning.
*   **The First Interaction**: The player has limited control. They can look around the cockpit. Most systems are dark. One console is flickering erratically—the **Resonance Attenuator**. Interacting with it is the only option.
*   **The First "Crack"**: Activating the console brings up the **Resonance Cracking** interface. It's a chaotic waveform. There are no instructions. The player must intuitively grasp that they need to use their controls to match the wave. As they get closer, the ship's systems hum with a bit more life; as they deviate, the alarms grow louder.
*   **A Moment of Stability**: Successfully matching the wave causes a cascade of effects: the main power thrums to life, the alarms cease, and the warning message changes to `CORE STABLE. TEMPORARILY.` The ship is alive, but the player understands this is not a permanent fix. The Ghost Signal is now a faint, ambient sound.
*   **The First Objective**: The ship's AI, its voice weak and distorted, speaks for the first time: `"Core... re-aligned. But the decay... continues. We need... a stronger signal. A cleaner pattern. Out there."` The external view activates, revealing the **Graveyard**. The objective is simple and clear: `Find a stable resonance source.`

## 3. The Graveyard (Minutes 10-30)

*   **First Flight**: The player now has full flight control. The ship feels sluggish and underpowered. The HUD is minimal, showing only core energy levels.
*   **Organic Discovery**: There is no waypoint. The player must use their own senses. As they fly closer to certain derelicts, the ambient Ghost Signal grows stronger, and the ship's computer might report: `RESONANCE DETECTED. SOURCE UNKNOWN.` This teaches the player to use the signal itself as a guide.
*   **The First Wreck**: The player approaches a small, shattered Aethelian scout ship. As they get close, they trigger their first **Whispering Echo**: a ghostly image of the scout ship, intact, firing its thrusters before glitching and disappearing.
*   **The First Lock**: On the hull of the real wreck, a **Resonance Lock** is now glowing faintly. It's the source of the signal they were tracking.
*   **The First Reward**: Cracking this lock is slightly more difficult than the first. Success yields their first true **Echo**: `Fragment ID: ENG-077-B` (the log from Chief Engineer Lena Petrova about the engine core reconfiguring itself). The AI comments: `"Schematic fragment... Aethelian engine design. Incomplete. But... useful. I can use this."` The ship's engine performance subtly improves—a direct, mechanical reward for narrative discovery.

## 4. The First Threat (Minutes 30-50)

*   **The Cascade**: Slotting the new `Engineering` Echo into the Attenuator reveals a new, stronger signal from a much larger derelict—a hulking Aethelian cruiser.
*   **The Warden**: As the player approaches the cruiser, a **Warden Scout** silently decloaks. It does not attack. It follows. Its presence is a constant, unnerving pressure. It is observing the player's use of the Resonance Attenuator.
*   **The Choice**: The cruiser has two visible Resonance Locks:
    *   **Lock 1 (External)**: An `Engineering` lock on an exposed power conduit. It's easy to access, but the Warden is watching closely.
    *   **Lock 2 (Internal)**: A `Security` lock deep inside a hull breach. It's harder to reach, requiring more skillful piloting, but it is out of the Warden's direct line of sight.
*   **The Consequence**:
    *   **Cracking the External Lock**: The moment the player succeeds, the Warden's eye turns bright red. Its mission changes from "Observe" to "Neutralize." The player must flee. This teaches them that using Resonance openly is dangerous.
    *   **Cracking the Internal Lock**: If the player successfully navigates the hull breach and cracks the lock without the Warden seeing them, they can slip away undetected. This teaches the value of stealth and situational awareness.

## 5. The First Breath (Minutes 50-60)

*   **A Fleeting Respite**: Whether they fought or fled, the player's ship is likely damaged, and their energy is low. The AI suggests finding a "low-resonance zone" to perform repairs—a place where the Ghost Signal is weak.
*   **The Makeshift Camp**: The player finds a small cluster of asteroids where the signal is almost non-existent. There is no pre-built base here. Instead, the player is introduced to the **Crafting** menu for the first time.
*   **Earning Safety**: The player must use the raw materials they've scavenged to craft basic repair patches and refuel their core. They have not been given a sanctuary; they have *created* one.
*   **The Lingering Mystery**: As they finish their repairs, they intercept a fragmented, encrypted transmission. It's not from the Aethelians. It's rough, human, and aggressive: `"...get a fix on that energy spike... that's not a Warden... could be another live one... a Drifter... that tech is ours..."` The transmission cuts out. The player is no longer just a survivor; they are a target. The first hour ends not with a bang, but with the chilling realization that the dangers of this place are far more complex than they imagined.
