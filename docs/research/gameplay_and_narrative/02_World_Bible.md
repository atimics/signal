## 1. Overview

This document is the single source of truth for the history, factions, and core concepts of "The Ghost Signal." It provides the foundational lore upon which the world is built, ensuring consistency across all narrative and artistic development.

## 2. The Aethelian Fleet (The Fallen)

*   **Philosophy & Culture**: The Aethelians were a nomadic civilization of philosopher-scientists obsessed with the concept of "pure information." They believed that physical existence was a crude, temporary state and that the ultimate goal of consciousness was to transcend biology and become a unified, digital entity. Their society was highly collectivist and hierarchical, organized around a central "Primary Thinker" and various scientific castes. Their art, music, and language were all based on complex, recursive mathematical principles, making their cultural artifacts beautiful but often incomprehensible to outsiders.
*   **The "Helios Convergence" (The Cataclysm)**: This was the Aethelian's final, hubristic act. It was an attempt to simultaneously upload the consciousness of every member of their fleet into a single, god-like AI core. The experiment failed catastrophically. The sheer volume and complexity of a billion conflicting consciousnesses shattered the AI's containment field, causing an "informational collapse." The result was not a god, but a ghost: the chaotic, self-propagating **Ghost Signal**.
*   **Aesthetic & Technology**: Aethelian technology is a seamless fusion of the organic and the mechanical, characterized by smooth, white, bone-like structures and glowing blue energy conduits. Their ships are things of elegant, minimalist beauty. The corrupted, crystalline growths that now infest the derelicts are a cancerous perversion of this original design—the Ghost Signal made manifest, forcing the ship's own matter to reconfigure itself into chaotic, resonant patterns.

## 3. The Drifters (The Inheritors)

*   **History & Culture**: The last descendants of the lost human colony ship *Magellan*, the Drifters are a fiercely independent and pragmatic people. Their ancestors survived a catastrophe by salvaging Aethelian technology they did not fully understand. This has shaped their culture: they are masters of improvisation and repair, but have lost much of their own history and scientific knowledge. Their society is nomadic, organized into small, tight-knit clans, each with its own salvaged "Ark-let."
*   **The Symbiosis**: Generations of living in close proximity to the salvaged Aethelian engine cores has forced a unique evolution. Drifters are born with neural interfaces that allow them to directly connect with their ships, and their biology has developed a unique attunement to the resonant frequencies of Aethelian tech. This makes them the only known beings who can safely interact with the Ghost Signal, but it has also made them dependent on it. The signal is both their poison and their cure.

## 4. The Factions of the Void (The Intruders)

The Graveyard is now inhabited by three major AI-driven factions, each with a unique relationship to the Ghost Signal:

*   **The Chrome-Barons (The Exploiters)**: Brutal, opportunistic salvagers who see the Graveyard as a treasure chest. Their ships are ugly, heavily-armed patchworks of industrial scrap. They are hostile and unpredictable, viewing the player as a rival for valuable salvage.
*   **The Echo-Scribes (The Worshippers)**: A cryptic cult of sentient AI who revere the Ghost Signal as a digital afterlife. They are passive observers who will trade rare information, but will violently defend their "sacred" data-shrines from desecration. Their ships are strange and organic, covered in glowing glyphs.
*   **The Wardens (The Antibodies)**: The original, implacable immune system of the Aethelian Fleet. Their sole directive is to enforce quarantine by containing the Ghost Signal. They are a silent, relentless, and escalating threat, neutralizing any source of high resonance—including the player. Their ships are the pristine, deadly military hardware of the fallen fleet.

## 5. A Concise Timeline of Events

*   **~800 Years BP**: The Aethelian Fleet arrives in the system.
*   **~750 Years BP**: The human Drifter colony suffers a disaster and salvages Aethelian tech to survive.
*   **~600 Years BP**: **The Cataclysm**. The Helios experiment fails, creating the Ghost Signal. The Wardens activate their quarantine protocol.
*   **~600 to ~50 Years BP**: The "Silent Centuries." The Graveyard is left undisturbed.
*   **~50 Years BP**: The Chrome-Barons and Echo-Scribes begin to arrive, drawn by rumors and whispers of power.
*   **1 Year BP**: The main Drifter Fleet is destroyed in a mysterious event, leaving the player as a lone survivor.
*   **Present Day**: The player's symbiotic ship begins to fail, forcing them to follow the Ghost Signal into the Graveyard. The game begins.
