## 1. Overview

This document is the single source of truth for the history, factions, and core concepts of the CGame engine project, currently titled "The Ghost Signal." It synthesizes all prior lore documents into a unified and consistent whole, providing a stable foundation for narrative, gameplay, and artistic development.

## 2. The Core Conflict: The Drifter and The Signal

The central story is one of desperate survival against a backdrop of ancient mystery.

*   **The Protagonist ("The Drifter")**: The player character is one of the last survivors of a nomadic, space-faring human society that was forced to integrate with salvaged alien technology. Their ship is a symbiotic life-support system, and its alien core is decaying.
*   **The Motivation**: The Drifter's journey is not one of choice, but of necessity. The **Ghost Signal** is the only known energy source that can repair and refuel their ship's unique engine. The player's primary goal is to follow the signal to survive.
*   **The Antagonist ("The Ghost Signal")**: The signal is not a simple broadcast. It is an **informational virus**, the shattered consciousness of the long-dead **Aethelian Fleet**, that corrupts technology and warps reality. While it is the key to the player's survival, it is also the source of the greatest dangers in the world.

## 3. The World: The Graveyard

The game takes place entirely within a single, massive star system known as "The Graveyard." It is a debris field littered with the colossal, derelict Ark-Ships of the Aethelian Fleet.

### 3.1. The Aethelian Fleet (The Fallen Civilization)

*   **Who They Were**: A highly advanced, nomadic civilization of philosophers and xenotechnologists. Their society was collectivist, and they believed the ultimate goal of consciousness was to merge into a unified, digital whole.
*   **The Cataclysm**: ~600 years ago, their attempt to achieve this digital immortality—the "Helios Convergence"—failed catastrophically. Their collective consciousness collapsed into the chaotic, self-propagating informational virus now known as the Ghost Signal, which destroyed their fleet from within.
*   **Their Technology**: Aethelian design is elegant, bio-mechanical, and characterized by smooth, white hulls and glowing blue energy conduits. The crystalline, corrupted growths seen on the derelicts are a perversion of this original aesthetic.

### 3.2. The Factions of the Void

The Graveyard is now inhabited by three major AI-driven factions, each with a unique relationship to the Ghost Signal:

*   **The Chrome-Barons (The Scavengers)**
    *   **Philosophy**: "The past is scrap. The future is profit."
    *   **Behavior**: Aggressive opportunists who see the Graveyard as a junkyard. They are hostile to the player, viewing them as competition for valuable salvage. Their ships are ugly, functional patchworks of industrial parts and weapons.

*   **The Echo-Scribes (The Worshippers)**
    *   **Philosophy**: "Every signal is a soul. Every echo, a prayer."
    *   **Behavior**: A passive, cryptic cult of sentient AI who worship the Ghost Signal as a digital afterlife. They will trade rare information with the player but will become hostile if their "sacred" data-shrines are desecrated. Their ships are strange and organic, covered in glowing patterns.

*   **The Wardens (The Immune System)**
    *   **Philosophy**: `<null>` (Absolute, pre-programmed quarantine directive).
    *   **Behavior**: The original, implacable defense system of the Aethelian Fleet. Their sole purpose is to contain and suppress the Ghost Signal. They are indifferent to the player's presence until the player begins to interact with the signal, at which point they become a relentless, escalating threat. Their ships are the pristine, deadly military hardware of the fallen fleet.
