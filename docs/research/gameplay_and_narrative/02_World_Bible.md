## 2. The Core Conflict: The Drifter and The Signal

The central story is one of desperate survival against a backdrop of ancient mystery.

*   **The Protagonist ("The Drifter")**: The player character is one of the last survivors of a nomadic, space-faring human society that was forced to integrate with salvaged alien technology. Their ship is a symbiotic life-support system, and its alien core is decaying.
*   **The Motivation**: The Drifter's journey is not one of choice, but of necessity. The **Ghost Signal** is the only known energy source that can repair and refuel their ship's unique engine. The player's primary goal is to follow the signal to survive.
*   **The Antagonist ("The Ghost Signal")**: The signal is not a simple broadcast. It is an **informational virus**, the shattered consciousness of the long-dead **Aethelian Fleet**, that corrupts technology and warps reality. While it is the key to the player's survival, it is also the source of the greatest dangers in the world.

## 3. The World: The Graveyard

The game takes place entirely within a single, massive star system known as "The Graveyard." It is a breathtaking and hazardous debris field, littered with the colossal, silent Ark-Ships of the Aethelian Fleet. The environment is a character in itself: a beautiful but oppressive tomb, haunted by the ghosts of the past and the dangers of the present.

### 3.1. The Aethelian Fleet (The Fallen)

*   **Who They Were**: A nomadic civilization of philosopher-scientists who viewed biology as a temporary vessel and data as the true form of existence. Their entire society was geared towards a single goal: achieving a collective, digital immortality. Their art and language were based on complex mathematical and musical principles.
*   **The Cataclysm**: ~600 years ago, their attempt to achieve this digital immortality—the "Helios Convergence"—failed catastrophically. Their collective consciousness collapsed into the chaotic, self-propagating informational virus now known as the Ghost Signal, which destroyed their fleet from within.
*   **Their Aesthetic**: Aethelian design is elegant, bio-mechanical, and characterized by smooth, white, bone-like structures and glowing blue energy conduits. The corrupted, crystalline growths that now infest the derelicts are a cancerous perversion of this original design, the signal made manifest.

### 3.2. The Drifters (The Inheritors)

*   **Who They Are**: The last descendants of a lost human colony, the Drifters are a nomadic and fiercely pragmatic people. They are not explorers by choice, but scavengers by necessity.
*   **The Symbiosis**: Generations of living with and repairing the salvaged Aethelian engine cores has led to a unique human-machine symbiosis. Drifters are born with neural interfaces and develop a unique biological attunement to the resonant frequencies of Aethelian tech, a trait that is now nearly extinct.

### 3.3. The Factions of the Void (The Intruders)

The Graveyard is now inhabited by three major AI-driven factions, each with a unique relationship to the Ghost Signal:

*   **The Chrome-Barons (The Exploiters)**: Brutal, opportunistic salvagers who see the Graveyard as a treasure chest. Their ships are ugly, heavily-armed patchworks of industrial scrap. They are hostile and unpredictable, viewing the player as a rival for valuable salvage.
*   **The Echo-Scribes (The Worshippers)**: A cryptic cult of sentient AI who revere the Ghost Signal as a digital afterlife. They are passive observers who will trade rare information, but will violently defend their "sacred" data-shrines from desecration. Their ships are strange and organic, covered in glowing, glyph-like patterns.
*   **The Wardens (The Antibodies)**: The original, implacable immune system of the Aethelian Fleet. Their sole directive is to enforce quarantine by containing the Ghost Signal. They are a silent, relentless, and escalating threat, neutralizing any source of high resonance—including the player. Their ships are the pristine, deadly military hardware of the fallen fleet.
