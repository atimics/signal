# Research Proposal: R10 - Audio System Architecture

**Status**: Proposed
**Author**: Gemini
**Date**: June 30, 2025

## 1. Abstract

The CGame engine currently lacks any audio capabilities, a critical omission for creating immersive and engaging games. This research proposal outlines a plan to design a comprehensive, data-oriented audio system. The goal is to define an architecture that is performant, flexible, and integrates cleanly with our existing ECS and asset pipeline.

## 2. Background

Audio is a fundamental component of the user experience in games, providing feedback, immersion, and emotional context. A well-designed audio system must handle tasks such as playing sound effects, managing background music, and spatializing audio sources in a 3D environment. To align with our engine's philosophy, this system must be implemented in a data-oriented manner, ensuring that audio processing does not become a performance bottleneck.

## 3. Research Questions

This research will address the following key questions to guide the design of the audio system:

1.  **Third-Party Libraries**: What are the trade-offs between leading open-source C/C++ audio libraries (e.g., SoLoud, miniaudio, OpenAL)? We will evaluate them based on feature set, performance, licensing, and ease of integration.
2.  **Graphics Abstraction Parallel**: How can we apply the PIMPL (Opaque Pointer) idiom, which we successfully used for our graphics layer, to create a clean abstraction for the chosen audio library?
3.  **Data-Oriented ECS Integration**: What new components are required (e.g., `AudioSourceComponent`, `AudioListenerComponent`)? How should they be designed to be data-oriented and integrate with our existing ECS?
4.  **Asset Pipeline Integration**: How will audio assets (e.g., `.wav`, `.ogg`) be processed and managed by our asset pipeline? What metadata is required in the asset index?
5.  **Feature Set**: What is the minimum viable feature set for our initial implementation? This includes defining requirements for 2D (UI sounds, music) and 3D (spatialized) audio, as well as sound grouping and mixing capabilities.

## 4. Proposed Methodology

1.  **Library Evaluation**: Conduct a thorough review of at least two candidate audio libraries, documenting their pros and cons in the context of our engine.
2.  **Architectural Design**: Create a high-level architectural diagram showing how the audio system will interact with the ECS, the asset pipeline, and the chosen third-party library.
3.  **API Specification**: Define the public-facing API for the audio system, including the structure of all new components and the function signatures for all new systems.
4.  **Proof-of-Concept**: Develop a small prototype to demonstrate the loading and playing of a sound effect within our existing application loop, validating the chosen library and abstraction.

## 5. Expected Outcomes

This research will produce the following deliverables:

1.  **A Library Recommendation**: A formal recommendation for a third-party audio library, supported by a detailed comparative analysis.
2.  **An Architectural Design Document**: A complete plan for the audio system, including diagrams, component definitions, and system APIs.
3.  **An Asset Pipeline Specification**: A clear definition of how audio assets will be managed, from source files to runtime loading.
4.  **A Test-Driven Development Plan**: A sprint-ready plan with a full suite of tests for the audio system, enabling a clean and verifiable implementation.

## 6. Priority

**High**. Audio is a core feature for most games, and its absence is a major gap in the engine's capabilities.
