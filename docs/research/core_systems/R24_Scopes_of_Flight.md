# Research & Design: Scopes of Flight and Propulsion

**ID**: `R24_Scopes_of_Flight`
**Author**: Gemini, Chief Science Officer
**Status**: **Draft**
**Related Research**: `R23_Propulsion_Systems`

## 1. Overview

To create a believable and strategically rich universe, we must define a clear hierarchy of propulsion technologies. This document outlines the three primary "scopes" of space flight in the world of "The Ghost Signal," the technologies that enable them, and their implications for gameplay and faction design.

## 2. Tier 1: Localized Flight (The Attraction Drive)

This is the technology that defines the core gameplay loop within the Graveyard.

*   **Technology**: The **Localized Attraction Drive ("A-Drive")**. As detailed in `R23`, this drive projects a focused gravity field onto a nearby massive surface, allowing for incredibly agile, aircraft-like maneuvers in dense environments.
*   **Capabilities**:
    *   **Range**: Extremely short. The field dissipates rapidly, making it effective only within a few kilometers of a large object (e.g., a derelict ship, an asteroid).
    *   **Speed**: Very high *relative to the surface it's attached to*. It allows for speeds that would be impossible with traditional thrusters in such tight quarters.
    *   **Energy Cost**: High. Requires constant power management.
*   **Gameplay Experience**: Fast, kinetic, disorienting, and skillful. This is the "dogfighting" and "canyon running" mode of flight.
*   **Used By**:
    *   **The Drifter (Player)**: Possesses a uniquely stable, salvaged Aethelian-hybrid A-Drive.
    *   **The Chrome-Barons**: Use crude, inefficient, and often unreliable A-Drives.
    *   **The Wardens**: Employ perfect, silent A-Drives that allow for seemingly impossible maneuvers.
    *   **The Echo-Scribes**: Use a passive, low-energy version for graceful, silent movement.

## 3. Tier 2: Interplanetary Flight (The Fusion Torch)

This is the standard, workhorse technology for travel *between* the major derelicts and moons within a single star system.

*   **Technology**: The **Impulse Fusion Torch**. This is a standard, human-designed engine that uses magnetic fields to contain and direct the plasma from a micro-fusion reaction. It is, in essence, a highly efficient rocket.
*   **Capabilities**:
    *   **Range**: Effectively unlimited within a single star system.
    *   **Speed**: Slow and deliberate. It follows pure Newtonian physics, requiring the ship to accelerate, flip, and then decelerate for long journeys. Top speed is high, but acceleration is poor.
    *   **Energy Cost**: Moderate. Requires a significant amount of fuel (typically helium-3 or deuterium), which is a key resource the player must manage.
*   **Gameplay Experience**: Strategic and deliberate. This is the "long haul" travel mode. The player is not dogfighting; they are managing fuel, calculating trajectories, and watching for long-range threats. It is a moment of quiet tension between the high-action sequences in the Graveyard.
*   **Used By**:
    *   **The Drifter**: The Symbiote is equipped with a standard, but aging, Fusion Torch for travel between derelicts. Keeping it fueled is a primary concern.
    *   **The Chrome-Barons**: Their larger "hauler" ships are essentially massive fuel tanks with a powerful Fusion Torch strapped to the back.
    *   **The Echo-Scribes**: They rarely use this form of travel, preferring to remain in their chosen "sacred" locations.

## 4. Tier 3: Interstellar Flight (The Aethelian Drive)

This is the lost, almost mythical technology of the fallen civilization. It represents the ultimate prize for anyone exploring the Graveyard.

*   **Technology**: The **Aethelian Spacetime Drive**. The true nature of this drive is a central mystery of the lore. It is not a traditional engine. As hinted at in the recovered engineering logs, it functions by directly manipulating spacetime, "pulling" the destination towards the ship rather than pushing the ship towards the destination.
*   **Capabilities**:
    *   **Range**: Interstellar. It is capable of crossing the vast distances between stars in a matter of weeks or months.
    *   **Speed**: Near-instantaneous on a local scale, but requires an immense "charge-up" time for interstellar jumps.
    *   **Energy Cost**: Astronomical. It is believed that the Aethelian Ark-Ships had to draw power directly from a star to perform a jump. The Ghost Signal itself is a chaotic, uncontrolled after-effect of this drive's activation during the Helios Convergence.
*   **Gameplay Experience**: This technology is **not directly available to the player** for most of the game. It is the ultimate endgame reward. The discovery of the secrets of the Aethelian Drive could form the basis for the final act of the story, where the player must assemble the components and knowledge to perform a single, critical jump.
*   **Used By**:
    *   **The Aethelian Fleet (Formerly)**: This was the technology that allowed them to travel the galaxy.
    *   **The Player (Potentially)**: The final goal of the game could be to repair the Aethelian Drive on a derelict Ark-Ship, allowing the player to finally escape the Graveyard and find a new home.

## 5. Conclusion

This three-tiered system of propulsion creates a clear and believable technological hierarchy. It provides a strong in-universe justification for our varied gameplay loops—from the fast-paced action of the A-Drive to the strategic planning of the Fusion Torch—and establishes a powerful, long-term aspirational goal for the player in the form of the lost Aethelian Drive.
