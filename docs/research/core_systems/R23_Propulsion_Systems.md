# Research & Design: Propulsion Systems and Surface Adhesion

**ID**: `R23_Propulsion_Systems`

## 1. The Problem: Newtonian Physics in a Non-Newtonian Playground

Standard space propulsion (ion drives, fusion torches, etc.) is based on Newtonian action-reaction. This is highly effective for travel in open space ("deep space") but becomes extremely clumsy and dangerous when navigating the tight, zero-gravity, multi-angled canyons of the Graveyard's derelicts.

To achieve the desired fast-paced, kinetic, and "sticky" gameplay, a new form of propulsion is required that is specifically adapted to this unique environment.

## 2. The Solution: The "Attraction Drive"

The core technology that allows for our desired gameplay is the **Localized Attraction Drive**, known colloquially among Drifters as an **"Attraction Drive"** or **"A-Drive"**.

### 2.1. Principle of Operation

The A-Drive does not generate thrust in the traditional sense. Instead, it projects a focused, short-range **variable gravity field**.

*   **Surface Attraction**: When a ship is near a large mass (like the hull of a derelict), the A-Drive projects its field onto that surface. This creates a powerful gravitational "attraction" between the ship and the surface, effectively giving the ship a temporary "down" direction.
*   **Propulsion**: The ship then uses a series of low-power, highly responsive micro-thrusters to "push off" from this self-generated gravity plane. This allows for incredibly agile, aircraft-like maneuvers, as the ship is constantly "falling" towards the surface it's attached to, and the thrusters are simply guiding that fall.
*   **"Magnetism" (The Player's Experience)**: To the player, this feels like a form of controllable magnetism. As they approach a surface, the A-Drive automatically engages, and the ship "sticks" to it. The flight controls then shift from a 6-DOF space model to a more intuitive, atmospheric flight model relative to that surface.

### 2.2. Gameplay Mechanics & Implications

This system creates a rich and deep set of gameplay possibilities:

*   **The "Price" of Adhesion**: Maintaining the gravity field requires a significant amount of energy. The player must constantly manage their ship's power. A stronger field allows for higher speeds and sharper turns but drains the reactor faster, leaving less power for weapons or shields. This is the "price" for the controlled magnetism.
*   **Surface Switching**: The most skillful pilots can learn to "un-stick" from one surface, float through a zero-g gap, and "re-stick" to another surface at a completely different angle. This would be a high-skill maneuver, requiring the player to manually disengage and re-engage the A-Drive at the perfect moment.
*   **Deep Space Travel**: The A-Drive is nearly useless in open space, far from any large mass to project its field onto. For travel between the major derelicts (the "satellites"), ships must rely on their inefficient, clumsy **Newtonian thrusters**. This creates a clear gameplay distinction:
    *   **Graveyard Flight**: Fast, agile, kinetic, and dangerous.
    *   **Deep Space Flight**: Slow, deliberate, and strategic.
*   **Specialized Ships**: This opens the door for ship specialization. A small, nimble "Canyon Runner" might have a powerful A-Drive but weak Newtonian thrusters, making it a king inside the wrecks but vulnerable in open space. A large "Hauler" might have the opposite, excelling at deep space travel but being clumsy in tight quarters.

### 2.3. Lore & Faction Integration

This technology is not new; it is a clever adaptation of salvaged Aethelian tech.

*   **The Aethelians**: The original Aethelian ships used a much more advanced version of this technology for maneuvering within their massive, city-sized Ark-Ships.
*   **The Drifters**: The Drifters, in their desperation, reverse-engineered this tech to create the more primitive, but still effective, A-Drives. The player's symbiotic ship has a uniquely stable and efficient A-Drive, thanks to its direct link to the Ghost Signal.
*   **The Factions**:
    *   **Chrome-Barons**: Their A-Drives are crude and inefficient, often "sparking" and failing at critical moments.
    *   **Echo-Scribes**: Their ships use a more advanced, almost silent version of the drive, allowing them to move with an eerie grace.
    *   **The Wardens**: Their drives are perfect, allowing them to perform maneuvers that seem to defy physics, making them incredibly dangerous opponents in the tight canyons of the derelicts.

## 3. Conclusion

The Attraction Drive provides a robust, scientifically-plausible (in-universe) explanation for our desired "sticky" flight model. It creates a clear and compelling distinction between different gameplay zones (Graveyard vs. Deep Space), opens the door for deep player skill expression (surface switching), and provides a rich foundation for ship specialization and faction identity. This is the key to unlocking the fun, kinetic, and unique gameplay experience at the heart of "The Ghost Signal."
