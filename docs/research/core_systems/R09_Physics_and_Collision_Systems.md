**Status**: Proposed
**Author**: Gemini
**Date**: June 30, 2025

## 1. Abstract

The CGame engine currently lacks a well-defined physics and collision system, which is a foundational requirement for creating dynamic and interactive experiences. This research proposal outlines a plan to analyze, design, and specify a robust, performant, and data-oriented physics and collision architecture that integrates seamlessly with our existing Entity-Component-System (ECS).

## 2. Background

A physics and collision system is critical for gameplay mechanics ranging from simple object interactions to complex character movements. Without it, the engine is limited to static scenes. Our core philosophy of data-oriented design dictates that this system must be built with a focus on cache-friendly data layouts and efficient, batch-processed calculations to ensure high performance. This research is the first step toward that goal.

## 3. Research Questions

To develop a comprehensive plan, this research will answer the following key questions:

1.  **Collision Detection Algorithms**: What are the performance and accuracy trade-offs between common 3D collision detection algorithms, such as Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB), Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB), and the Separating Axis Theorem (SAT)? Which is most suitable for our engine's initial needs?
2.  **Spatial Partitioning**: How can we accelerate collision detection? What are the implementation complexities and performance benefits of different spatial partitioning structures like Grids, Octrees, or Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVH)?
3.  **Collision Response**: Once a collision is detected, how should the engine respond? This research will compare simple positional correction against a more physically accurate impulse-based resolution system.
4.  **Data-Oriented Design**: How can we design the `PhysicsComponent`, `ColliderComponent`, and other related data structures to be maximally cache-friendly and align with our ECS architecture?
5.  **System Integration**: What are the best practices for integrating the physics and collision systems into our existing frequency-based system scheduler?

## 4. Proposed Methodology

1.  **Literature Review**: Analyze the architectures of well-known physics engines (e.g., Box2D, PhysX, Bullet) and review academic papers on real-time collision.
2.  **Comparative Analysis**: Create a detailed written analysis comparing at least two collision detection algorithms and two spatial partitioning schemes.
3.  **Prototyping**: Develop small, isolated C prototypes to validate the performance and complexity of the chosen algorithms.
4.  **System Design**: Produce a detailed architectural document outlining the proposed components, system functions, and their interactions.

## 5. Expected Outcomes

The successful completion of this research will deliver:

1.  **A Formal Recommendation**: A document recommending a specific set of algorithms for collision detection, spatial partitioning, and collision response, with clear justifications.
2.  **A Detailed Design Document**: A complete architectural plan for the physics and collision systems, including API definitions for all new components and systems.
3.  **A Test-Driven Development Plan**: A sprint-ready plan that includes a full suite of tests to be written in the Unity framework, enabling a human developer to implement the system with confidence.

## 6. Priority

**High**. This is a foundational engine system required for the majority of game genres and is a prerequisite for many future features.
