# Sprint 03 Review: PBR Pipeline & Renderer Refactoring

**Period:** June 2025

## Sprint Goal

Refactor the rendering pipeline in preparation for the Sokol transition by modularizing the code and implementing a more advanced, PBR-like material system.

## Review

### What was accomplished:

*   **Renderer Modularization:** The monolithic `render_3d.c` file was broken down into smaller, more focused components: `render_camera.c`, `render_lighting.c`, and `render_mesh.c`. This has greatly improved the organization and maintainability of the rendering code.
*   **Enhanced Material System:** The `Material` struct was extended to support multiple textures (diffuse, normal, specular, emission) and PBR-like properties such as roughness and metallic. This lays the foundation for a physically based rendering pipeline.
*   **Asset System Improvements:** The asset system was updated to parse and handle the new material properties and textures. New functions were added for managing materials as a repository, allowing for the creation of material variants.
*   **Semantic Asset Generation:** The `asset_compiler.py` script was improved to generate more "semantic" materials and textures, with colors and properties based on the mesh name. This improves the default visual quality of the assets and provides a better starting point for artists.

### What went well:

*   The refactoring has made the rendering code much cleaner and easier to understand.
*   The new material system is a significant step towards a modern, PBR-like rendering pipeline.
*   The improvements to the asset compiler streamline the asset creation process.

### What could be improved:

*   The PBR lighting calculations are still a simple approximation. A more physically accurate lighting model will need to be implemented in the shader once the Sokol transition is complete.
*   The material repository is still in its early stages. More features could be added, such as the ability to load a shared library of materials.

## Retrospective

This sprint was a crucial preparatory step for the upcoming Sokol transition. The refactoring and the new material system have brought the engine's rendering architecture much closer to the target state, which will make the migration to Sokol significantly smoother. The project is now in an excellent position to begin the final phase of the transition to the new graphics API.
