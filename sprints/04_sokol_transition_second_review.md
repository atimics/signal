# Sprint 04: Sokol API Transition - Second Review

**Review Date:** June 29, 2025
**Sprint Period:** July 2025
**Reviewer:** System Analysis

## Executive Summary

The Sokol migration is **partially complete**, with a functional `sokol_main` entry point in `src/main.c`. However, the project remains in a state of **dual implementation**, with the legacy SDL-based simulation in `src/test.c` still present and fully functional. This split implementation is a significant source of confusion and risk. The immediate priority must be to consolidate the application logic into a single, Sokol-native entry point and eliminate the legacy `test.c` file.

## Progress Analysis

### ðŸŸ¢ Completed Objectives

*   **Sokol Headers Integrated:** All necessary Sokol headers are included and correctly configured.
*   **Makefile Configured:** The `Makefile` correctly links against platform-specific graphics libraries for Sokol.
*   **`sokol_main` Implemented:** A `sokol_main` entry point exists in `src/main.c` with a basic event loop and initialization of the Sokol graphics context.

### ðŸ”´ Incomplete Objectives

*   **SDL Not Removed:** The `src/test.c` file still contains the primary simulation logic, including an SDL event loop and input handling. This file represents a significant dependency on the legacy SDL system.
*   **PBR Rendering Pipeline Not Implemented:** The rendering logic in `src/main.c` is a placeholder. No shaders have been written, and no `sokol_gfx` draw calls are being made.
*   **Asset System Not Migrated:** The asset loading system has not been updated to work with Sokol.

## Risk Assessment

### ðŸ”´ High Risk Items

1.  **Dual Implementation:** The presence of two application entry points (`main` in `test.c` and `sokol_main` in `main.c`) is a major source of confusion and makes it difficult to reason about the application's behavior. This is a critical issue that must be resolved immediately.
2.  **Incomplete Migration:** The migration is far from complete. The rendering and asset systems, which are core components of the application, have not been migrated to Sokol.

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Risk Items

1.  **Shader Development:** The PBR shader implementation has not yet been started. This is a complex task that will require significant effort.
2.  **Input Handling:** The input handling logic is still tied to SDL. This will need to be migrated to the Sokol event system.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 2-3 Days)

1.  **Consolidate Entry Points:** The logic from `src/test.c` should be merged into `src/main.c`. The `main` function in `test.c` should be removed, and the `sokol_main` function in `main.c` should become the sole entry point for the application.
2.  **Remove `src/test.c`:** Once the logic has been merged, the `src/test.c` file should be deleted to eliminate the dual implementation.
3.  **Update Makefile:** The `Makefile` should be updated to reflect the removal of `src/test.c`.

### Medium-term Strategy (1-2 Weeks)

1.  **Implement Basic Rendering:** A simple rendering pipeline should be implemented using `sokol_gfx`. This should be sufficient to render a single triangle or a simple mesh.
2.  **Migrate Asset System:** The asset loading system should be updated to create `sg_buffer` and `sg_image` resources.
3.  **Implement PBR Shader:** The PBR shader should be implemented and integrated into the rendering pipeline.

## Sprint Outlook

The original timeline for this sprint was ambitious. Given the current state of the migration, it is unlikely that all objectives will be completed by the end of July. The focus should be on completing the consolidation of the entry points and implementing a basic rendering pipeline. The PBR implementation will likely need to be pushed to the next sprint.

## Conclusion

The Sokol migration has made some progress, but the dual implementation is a major issue that needs to be addressed immediately. By consolidating the entry points and focusing on a phased migration, the project can get back on track and successfully complete the transition to Sokol.

**Overall Rating:** ðŸŸ¡ **PARTIALLY COMPLETE BUT HIGH-RISK**
**Recommended Action:** Consolidate entry points and eliminate the dual implementation.
