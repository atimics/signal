# Sprint 04: Sokol API Transition - Final Review

**Review Date:** June 29, 2025
**Sprint Period:** July 2025
**Reviewer:** System Analysis

## 1. Executive Summary

The Sokol migration is at a critical juncture. Foundational work is complete, including the integration of Sokol headers and build system configuration. A basic `sokol_main` entry point now exists in `src/main.c` and successfully initializes a window.

However, the project is in a high-risk state of **dual implementation**. The legacy SDL-based entry point and simulation loop in `src/test.c` remain fully functional and are not integrated with the new Sokol code. This split architecture is the single greatest source of technical debt and risk, making the project difficult to build, debug, and reason about.

The immediate and critical priority is to **consolidate the application into a single, Sokol-native entry point**, eliminate all legacy SDL dependencies, and complete the rendering pipeline.

## 2. Progress Analysis

### ðŸŸ¢ Completed Objectives

*   **Sokol Headers Integrated:** All necessary headers (`sokol_app.h`, `sokol_gfx.h`, etc.) are present and configured in `src/`.
*   **Build System Updated:** The `Makefile` correctly links against platform-specific libraries (Metal on Darwin, OpenGL on Linux).
*   **Basic `sokol_main` Entry Point:** A `sokol_main` function is implemented in `src/main.c`, capable of creating a window and running a basic event loop.
*   **Strong Architectural Foundation:** The ECS architecture, component-based camera, and modular asset pipeline are well-prepared for the new graphics backend.

### ðŸ”´ Critical Incomplete Objectives

*   **SDL Dependency Removal:** The project remains heavily dependent on SDL. `src/test.c` contains a complete, parallel implementation of the application's main loop, event handling, and simulation logic.
*   **Asset System Migration:** The `assets.c` module has not been updated. It still loads textures as SDL surfaces and does not create the `sg_buffer` or `sg_image` resources required by `sokol_gfx`.
*   **PBR Rendering Pipeline:** The rendering pipeline is not yet implemented. No shaders have been written, no `sg_pipeline` objects are created, and no `sg_draw` calls are made. The rendering logic in `render_3d.c` is placeholder.
*   **UI System Migration:** The UI system in `ui.c` is disabled and needs a complete re-implementation using a Sokol-compatible library.

## 3. Key Risks and Blockers

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Dual Entry Point

The most severe issue is the presence of two conflicting application entry points:
1.  `int main(int argc, char* argv[])` in `src/test.c` (Legacy SDL)
2.  `sapp_desc sokol_main(int argc, char* argv[])` in `src/main.c` (New Sokol)

This makes the codebase confusing and unstable. The `test.c` implementation is currently the *de facto* application, rendering the Sokol work in `main.c` effectively dead code until the build process is changed.

### ðŸŸ¡ HIGH: Incomplete Rendering & Asset Pipeline

The rendering pipeline is non-functional. This is blocked by the asset system's inability to provide GPU-ready resources (`sg_buffer`, `sg_image`) to `sokol_gfx`.

## 4. Consolidated Action Plan

The following steps must be taken to resolve the current issues and complete the migration in an orderly fashion.

### Phase 1: Unification & Cleanup (Immediate Priority)

1.  **Consolidate Entry Points:**
    *   Migrate the scene loading and simulation logic from the `main` function in `test.c` into the `init` and `frame` callbacks in `src/main.c`.
    *   Migrate the input handling logic (e.g., camera switching) from the SDL event loop in `test.c` to the `event` callback in `src/main.c`, mapping `SDLK` key codes to `SAPP_KEYCODE` values.
2.  **Eliminate `test.c`:** Once all logic has been migrated, **delete `src/test.c`**.
3.  **Update Makefile:** Modify the `Makefile` to compile and link `src/main.c` instead of `src/test.c`.
4.  **Clean Up Dead Code:** Delete any other obsolete files like `main_old.c`, `render_3d_old.c`, etc., if they exist.

### Phase 2: Core Rendering Implementation (1-2 Weeks)

1.  **Migrate Asset System:**
    *   Modify `assets.c` to load mesh data into `sg_buffer` objects.
    *   Use a library like `stb_image` to load texture data and create `sg_image` objects.
2.  **Implement Basic Rendering:**
    *   Write a minimal GLSL shader for basic textured rendering.
    *   Create the necessary `sg_pipeline` and `sg_shader` objects in `render_3d.c`.
    *   Update `render_entity_3d` to create `sg_bindings` that link mesh and texture resources.
    *   Perform an `sg_apply_bindings` and `sg_draw` call for each renderable entity.

### Phase 3: PBR and UI (2-3 Weeks)

1.  **Implement PBR Pipeline:**
    *   Write the full PBR GLSL shader.
    *   Update the `Material` struct and asset pipeline to support PBR properties (roughness, metallic).
    *   Update the rendering system to pass the necessary uniforms to the PBR shader.
2.  **Re-enable UI:**
    *   Integrate a Sokol-compatible immediate-mode GUI library (e.g., `sokol_imgui`).
    *   Re-implement the debug overlay and message log.

## 5. Conclusion

The Sokol migration is behind schedule but recoverable. The architectural groundwork is solid, but the project's stability is compromised by the dual implementation. By aggressively consolidating the codebase around the new Sokol entry point and systematically migrating the remaining modules (assets, rendering, UI), the project can be brought back to a stable, maintainable, and modern state.

**Overall Rating:** ðŸ”´ **HIGH-RISK / BLOCKED**
**Recommended Action:** Immediately execute Phase 1 to unify the codebase. Defer new feature work until the migration is complete.
