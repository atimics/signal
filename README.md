# CGame: A Data-Oriented 3D Game Engine

CGame is a high-performance, data-oriented 3D game engine written in C99. It features an advanced Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture and is currently undergoing a migration to the modern, cross-platform **Sokol graphics API** for rendering. The engine is designed for creating emergent, AI-driven gameplay in a dynamic universe.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **macOS**: `brew install sdl2` (still needed for windowing temporarily)
- **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev build-essential`
- **GCC** with C99 support

### Building and Running

The project is currently in a transitional state. The default `make run` command executes the legacy SDL application. To run the new Sokol application, you must specify the `main.c` entry point.

```bash
# Build and run the new Sokol application
make clean && make SRC_FILES="src/main.c src/core.c src/systems.c src/data.c src/assets.c src/render_3d.c" && ./cgame

# Build and run the legacy SDL application (for comparison)
make clean && make && make run
```

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

- **`/assets`**: Contains all game assets, including meshes, materials, and shaders.
- **`/data`**: Game data, such as scene definitions and entity templates.
- **`/docs`**: All project documentation, including architecture, guides, and reports.
- **`/src`**: The C99 source code for the game engine.
- **`/tools`**: Scripts and tools for asset processing and development.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

CGame is built on three core principles:
1.  **Data-Oriented Design**: Components are simple data structures, and systems are functions that operate on them. This leads to efficient, cache-friendly code.
2.  **Entity-Component-System (ECS)**: Entities are created by composing components, allowing for flexible and emergent behaviors.
3.  **System Scheduling**: Game logic is implemented in systems that run at different frequencies (e.g., physics at 60Hz, AI at 10Hz) for optimal performance.

## üéÆ Controls (Sokol App)

- **W/A/S/D**: Move camera forward/left/back/right
- **Arrow Keys**: Turn camera
- **ESC**: Exit
- **F1**: Toggle Debug UI (planned)
