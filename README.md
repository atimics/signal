# CGame: A Data-Oriented 3D Game Engine

CGame is a high-performance, data-oriented 3D game engine written in C99. It features an advanced Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture and uses the modern, cross-platform **Sokol** graphics API for rendering.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C99-compliant compiler (e.g., `clang` or `gcc`).
- **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools for Metal support.
- **Linux**: `build-essential`, `libgl1-mesa-dev`, `libx11-dev`.
- Python 3 for the asset compilation pipeline.

### Building and Running

The project uses a simple Makefile.

```bash
# Clean, build, and run the engine
make clean && make && make run
```

## ðŸ“š Documentation
