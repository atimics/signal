# CGame: A Data-Oriented 3D Game Engine

CGame is a high-performance, data-oriented 3D game engine written in C99. It features an advanced Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture and uses the modern, cross-platform **Sokol** graphics API for rendering.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C99-compliant compiler (e.g., `clang` or `gcc`).
- **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools for Metal support.
- **Linux**: `build-essential`, `libgl1-mesa-dev`, `libx11-dev`.
- Python 3 for the asset compilation pipeline.

### Building and Running

The project uses a simple Makefile.

```bash
# Clean, build, and run the engine
make clean && make && make run
```

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

CGame is built on three core principles:
1.  **Data-Oriented Design**: Components are simple data structures, and systems are functions that operate on them. This leads to efficient, cache-friendly code.
2.  **Entity-Component-System (ECS)**: Entities are created by composing components, allowing for flexible and emergent behaviors.
3.  **System Scheduling**: Game logic is implemented in systems that run at different frequencies (e.g., physics at 60Hz, AI at 10Hz) for optimal performance.

## üéÆ Controls

- **W/A/S/D**: Move camera forward/left/back/right
- **Arrow Keys**: Turn camera
- **ESC**: Exit
