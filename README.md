**In the silent graveyards of space, a ghost signal is calling. And you are the only one who can answer.**

**SIGNAL** is a high-performance, data-oriented 3D game engine and the foundation for a single-player space exploration game. It is written in C99, features a pure Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture, and uses the modern, cross-platform **Sokol** graphics API for rendering.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C99-compliant compiler (e.g., `clang` or `gcc`).
- **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools for Metal support.
- **Linux**: `build-essential`, `libgl1-mesa-dev`, `libx11-dev`.
- Python 3 for the asset compilation pipeline (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
- `clang-format` for code formatting (e.g., `brew install clang-format` or `apt-get install clang-format`).

### Building and Running

The project uses a simple Makefile. The first build will automatically compile the assets.

```bash
# Clean, build, and run the engine
make clean && make && make run

# Run the automated test suite
make test
```

## 📚 Documentation Hub

For detailed information about the engine's architecture, development workflow, and creative vision, please see the main **[Documentation Hub](./docs/README.md)**. This is the primary entry point for all developers.

### 🔄 Development Standards

- **[Release & Branch Management](./docs/RELEASE_STANDARDS.md)** - Comprehensive standards for releases, branching, and quality gates
- **[Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** - How to contribute to the project
- **[API Documentation](./docs/API_REFERENCE.md)** - Technical API reference (coming soon)

## 🔧 Development Workflow

This project follows strict development standards with automated CI/CD pipelines:

### 🌳 Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production-ready releases only
- `develop` - Integration branch for features  
- `feature/*` - Individual feature development

### 🚀 Continuous Integration
- **Build Pipeline**: Automated builds for macOS, Linux, and WebAssembly
- **Test Suite**: Comprehensive unit and integration testing
- **Release Pipeline**: Semantic versioning with automated GitHub releases
- **Quality Gates**: Mandatory code review and manual verification

### 📋 Pull Request Requirements
All changes must go through pull requests with:
- Automated testing on all platforms
- Code review from maintainers
- Manual verification checklist (for main branch)
- Conventional commit format

See [Repository Setup Guide](./.github/REPOSITORY_SETUP.md) for complete GitHub configuration.

## 📈 Project Status

This project is under active development.

**Recent Accomplishments**:
*   **Asset Pipeline Overhaul**: Migrated from a slow, text-based asset system to a high-performance, pre-compiled binary format.
*   **Rendering Stabilization**: Resolved all critical rendering bugs, enabling the stable loading and display of textured 3D models.
*   **UV Layout Pipeline**: Implemented a robust, data-driven asset pipeline that generates UV layout SVGs from mesh UVs, enabling artist-friendly texture workflow.
*   **Vision Solidified**: Established a clear and compelling creative vision, "The Ghost Signal," to guide all future development.

**Current Focus**:
*   **Data-Driven Architecture**: Fully data-driven scene/entity/mesh/material/texture management with version control and artist-friendly workflows.
